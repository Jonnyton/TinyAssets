What surprised me: the deploy workflow already had nearly all facts needed for a release receipt; the gap was mostly that none of them were written into a machine-readable runtime artifact.

Pattern worth capturing: release observability should be deploy-published and status-read-only. That keeps `get_status` safe while still making live drift checkable by chatbots and local tools.

One thing I would do differently: start by adding the deploy workflow structure test before editing YAML, because this repo already has strong workflow-contract tests and they make the intended step ordering explicit.
