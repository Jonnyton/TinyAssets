"""Supervisor liveness is memoized, with a TTL chosen against the watchdog's threshold.

Measured on the live box 2026-08-28: computing it reads ~59 per-worker liveness files
and was 58% of what remained of a `get_status` request after the storage walk was
memoized. Caching both took a status read from 73 ms to 15 ms — a 4.8x cut in the CPU
each request costs, which is the same thing as 4.8x the requests one core can serve.

Caching a LIVENESS probe is the kind of change that can quietly break monitoring, so the
TTL is justified rather than picked: `docs/specs/daemon-liveness-watchdog.md` alerts on
`stuck_pending_max_age_s < 60`, and the real wedges it exists for measured 312 s, 420 s
and 851 s. A 5-second-old snapshot under-reports an age by at most 5 s, which cannot
flip a 60-second decision.
