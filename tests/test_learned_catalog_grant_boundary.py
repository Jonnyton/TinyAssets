"""A learned model id is a candidate to GRANT, never an admitted one.

Written before the fix, on the lead's instruction, because the first version of
this change asserted the property from the ABSENCE of a call to
``accepted_native_selection`` instead of from the artefact. Codex refuted it: the
native path did ``catalog = filtered = _native_models(...)`` and handed the same
object to ``admitted``, so a contributed id arrived with
``in_candidate_catalog=true``, the dropdown treated it as usable, selection
succeeded, and only EXECUTION rejected it. Selectable choices that fail is the
"looks real, isn't" failure Hard Rule 8 exists to prevent.

So this asserts the document a client actually reads, on both sides of the grant:

* contributed, not granted -> ``in_candidate_catalog`` false AND a reason saying
  why, so the dropdown files it under "Needs access" rather than offering it;
* granted -> admitted, selectable, and a turn really runs on it.

The second half is what makes the first half worth having. A store that only ever
refused would pass a negative assertion and be useless.
