"""Engine events wake an owner's subscribed automation through the real pump.

An ``event`` automation is a subscription. The engine emits ``run_completed``
from ``runs.update_run_status`` (and the boot sweep) and
``pending_request_answered`` from ``storage.pending_requests.resolve_request``;
each match stores a ``once`` wake, which the real consumer pump fires.

Driven through the real emitters: a real run row taken terminal by the real
status writer, a real pending request answered through the connector's own
``answer_request``, the real ``register_automation``, the real store and the
real consumer. The only substitute is ``_execute``, the seam
``tinyassets.automations`` names for tests -- it fakes the graph a wake runs,
never the event, the scheduling or the checks.
