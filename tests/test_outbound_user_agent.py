"""Every outbound call says who it is, and a CDN block is classified as one.

Requirement source: the P1 filed as
``docs/concerns/2026-09-30-no-user-agent-blocks-cdn-fronted-webhooks.md`` while
proving capability URLs live.

THE reproduction, 2026-09-30, against this platform's OWN
``https://tinyassets.io/mcp/hooks/<token>`` receiver through the real effector.
One variable changed:

    without User-Agent -> 403  "error code: 1010\\n"      (the Cloudflare edge)
    with    User-Agent -> 404  {"error":"not_found"}      (the application)

``_SsrfHardenedHttpDriver`` added no ``User-Agent`` on an ordinary call — the
only one in the codebase was on the redirect download path. So EVERY outbound
call on EVERY auth scheme went out UA-less, and the destinations users actually
build channels to are all CDN-fronted: Slack, Discord, Zapier, Make, and
``tinyassets.io``.

The failure was also unactionable from the owner's seat, which is the half that
made it a P1 rather than a curiosity: ``error code: 1010`` classified as
``external_write_failed``, whose served advice is "a reason you can fix ... run
again yourself ... try at most twice". None of that is true of an edge block,
and the owner — who holds both real repairs — was never told.
