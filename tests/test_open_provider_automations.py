"""An owner's automation runs on their own api_key_http source.

Registration refused an open (api_key_http) assignment from #2693, citing a
foreground rule that 0f96c04d removed on 2026-09-03; the runtime check never
refused one. So a free account -- whose only source is an API key -- could not
create an automation, a once-wake (#4067) or an event trigger (#4079) at all.

Drives the real path: ``register_automation`` on a real open assignment, then
``run_due_automation`` on a fresh thread with no request identity, as the
consumer runs it, through the real session, router and ``ApiKeyHttpProvider``.
Only the remote transport is synthetic (tests/test_work_model_selection.py).
