"""Negative regressions for cloud-only runtime admission (change task 9).

Test-matrix rows 1, 2 and the bounded 4/5 pair from
`openspec/changes/cloud-only-runtime-admission/design.md`. These are written
against the **unfixed** tree on purpose: the negatives assert the refusal that
tasks 6-7 are supposed to add, so they fail here at the missing-refusal
assertion and pass once admission is actually wired. The positives assert
preserved behaviour and pass at baseline, which is what proves the negatives
are refusals rather than broken setup.

Nothing here is enforcement, and nothing here is production authority. Every
case runs on a temp data root with a fixture DB and an injected resolver
(`design.md` § Local isolated tests vs production authority): a green run
establishes no custody, no cloud fact and no live claim. The resolver is
injected through the existing `ProcessProvenanceObservation` seam — no
environment bypass, no tests-only production helper, and no production edit.
