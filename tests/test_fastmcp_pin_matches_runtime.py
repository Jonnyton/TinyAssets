"""The fastmcp bound must be the same in every place that declares it.

On 2026-08-31 the canonical `pyproject.toml` carried `fastmcp>=3.0` while the
plugin runtime carried `fastmcp>=3.2,<4`. pip resolved the canonical one to
fastmcp 4.0.0 / mcp 2.1.1, which dropped `request_ctx` from
`mcp.server.lowlevel.server`. Seven tests failed with ImportError and
`required-tests` went red on every open PR at once -- a repo-wide merge stop
caused by a dependency release, with no commit touching the broken code.

Production was on 3.4.7 and kept serving, but `tinyassets/auth/middleware.py`
and `tinyassets/universe_server.py` both import that name on the LIVE MCP path,
so a container rebuild would have taken the public connector down (Hard Rule
11).

The bound is only as good as its weakest declaration, so this asserts they
agree rather than asserting one magic string: a future upgrade moves them
together or fails here.
