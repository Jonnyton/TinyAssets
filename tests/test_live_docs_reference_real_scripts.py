r"""No LIVE instruction may name a script or test that does not exist.

This class of defect appeared twice in one PR, both times invisible to a
name-based grep of the code, because nothing *imported* the deleted file:

* `scripts/codex_review.py` was consolidated away, taking eleven fail-closed
  dispatch tests with it, while a handoff still told operators to run it.
* `scripts/check_background_authority_inventory.py` was deleted as a "dead
  script" while its own audit called it "the executable closure guard" for
  `harden-background-branch-execution-authority`. The TEST was its CI wiring, so
  deleting both removed the guard entirely.

Scoped deliberately to surfaces a reader treats as CURRENT. Dated audits,
design notes, and archived OpenSpec changes are historical records: naming a
script that has since been deleted is correct there, and asserting otherwise
would force edits to the record of what happened.
