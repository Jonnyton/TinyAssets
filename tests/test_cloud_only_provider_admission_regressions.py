"""Negative regressions for the provider lane that never claims (task 9).

Test-matrix row 3 (`openspec/changes/cloud-only-runtime-admission/design.md`
§ Test matrix) for enforcement site **(C)** — the last provider-authority
boundary. `design.md` § Enforcement sites says this site "carries the whole
foreground/served surface, because those paths never call `claim_assigned` and
stamp the class as a literal (`foreground_run_provider.py:484,595`)". The
background served lane it also named, and `claim_assigned` itself, were deleted
with the fleet-era carrier (dark-code deletion plan C3a); the foreground lane is
the one that remains.

Red-before, on purpose: against the unfixed tree the negative reaches the
provider-dispatch fake and fails on the "never invoked" assertion, and the
positive passes. The positives are the discriminator — they run the *same*
fixture, the *same* per-universe authority and the *same* inputs, changing only
the injected verdict, so a negative that goes red is a missing refusal rather
than broken setup.

Nothing here is enforcement and nothing establishes a cloud fact. The verdict
is injected through the existing `ProcessProvenanceObservation` seam
(`platform_runtime_provenance.py` module docstring: "Tests inject a
reader/resolver"), so no metadata socket is opened. Every provider dispatch is
a local callable: the foreground lane runs on the `_CountingProvider` router
and the monkeypatched `call_provider` that `_run_branch` installs. No listener,
no server, no subprocess, no network, no production credential, and no
production edit.
