"""A universe belongs to an authenticated person. That is the whole gate.

Founder rule, 2026-08-28: no universe should exist that is not bound to a WorkOS
user. Founder directive, 2026-09-30: an account has exactly two limits -- the
cloud bytes it occupies and the agent runs it may have at once -- so HOW MANY
universes a person owns is not a condition of creating one. The subscription gate
that used to live here is gone; a second universe costs storage, and storage is
already metered.

Enforced on the public surface rather than in `_action_create_universe`, which is
a shared primitive that fixtures, migrations and internal seeding call with no
authenticated subject. Gating it there refused 23 legitimate internal callers;
that was the signal the rule is about PEOPLE and belongs where a person asks.
