"""The served guidance must teach the grant shape that makes patching possible.

Founder, 2026-08-29, after the universe successfully shipped a one-line colour
change but could not do anything more: the goal was not met *"in any real useful
ongoing sense of users being able to scope, build and push patches to github"*.

The cause was not a missing capability. ``path_template`` has supported a
multi-segment ``{name+}`` rest placeholder all along, and
``/repos/o/r/contents/{path+}`` reaches every file in a repo while still refusing
traversal and other repos. But every example in the served guidance was an exact
path, and the rest placeholder was mentioned nowhere the agent could see it — so
the agent asked for one file at a time, which is the one thing it cannot
enumerate up front, and each new file cost the user another approval.

These tests hold both halves together: the guidance must TEACH the pattern, and
the pattern must actually WORK. Either alone is how this regressed.
