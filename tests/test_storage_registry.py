"""The account storage registry: the stores BESIDE universe directories.

account-storage-quota D3: run records, checkpoints, uploads, branches and commons
pages live in shared stores at the data root, so a universe scan never sees them.
Each is measured from a column that RECORDS whose it is -- one focused test per
store, plus the cross-user split (A's bytes never land on B).
