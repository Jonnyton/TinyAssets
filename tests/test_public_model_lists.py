"""Sharing is a reviewed file; a typed id is personal forever.

The founder's chosen design (2026-09-26), after three more elaborate ones were built
and refuted:

* a charset could not tell a public model name from a private account-bearing
  selector -- it admitted Bedrock ARNs and rejected real selectors like `sonnet[1m]`;
* a distinct-owner threshold did not imply "public" either, because two colleagues
  share one organisation's private deployment id;
* attestation plus peer confirmation worked, and was over-built for the problem.

So: typed ids never leave their owner, and sharing happens where a human already
reviews things -- `models/<source-kind>.json`, with agent-opened PRs and a CI check.
