"""A sign-in must never adopt a handle the caller chose.

The store no longer holds RAW WorkOS refresh tokens (they are sealed --
test_refresh_session_seal.py), but the file modes and the no-adoption rule still
have to hold, so these keep running against the sealed store. Two properties
matter, and both were broken:

1. The `authorization_code` grant wrote the NEW user's refresh token under whatever
   `session_ref` arrived in the request body, validated for SHAPE only. Plant a handle in
   a victim's localStorage, wait for them to sign in, then renew with it: their session.
2. The files were written with `os.replace` and no chmod, so they landed at the process
   umask. Observed 0644 on production -- world-readable inside the container.
