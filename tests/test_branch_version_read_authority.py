"""No path hands one user another user's private branch history.

patch_branch mints a version snapshot before and after every edit, private
branches included, so a branch's versions are its prompts over time -- including
text the owner later removed. Node edit history is the same record per node.
The readers of both checked nothing. The connector's deprecated ``extensions``
tool was hidden from tools/list but still dispatchable, so any signed-in user
could call them by name. Astra refute review of #4107, 2026-09-30.

Two layers, each tested on its own:

* the connector no longer dispatches ``extensions`` at all (the route the leak
  took); the first test fails on the tree that had the leak;
* every reader of versions or node history asks the branch's readability gate,
  so no future route to them can repeat it.
