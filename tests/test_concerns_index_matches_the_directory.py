"""Every concern file carries its own index row, and nobody hand-keeps a table.

`AGENTS.md` names `docs/concerns/README.md` as the thing to skim when an area
has known-unresolved findings, and a concern's whole purpose is to be found by
the next session. On 2026-08-31 ten of twenty-eight files were missing from the
hand-kept table, including a **P0**. Filing and linking were two steps, so they
drifted.

The first fix made the table and the directory agree in both directions. That
worked, and it made every PR that filed or resolved a concern edit the same
table, so parallel PRs conflicted on it. Since 2026-09-27 the row lives in each
file's front-matter and `scripts/concerns_index.py` prints the table. Filing is
one step again, and it touches one file.
