"""The sentence a failed served turn shows the user names the TRUE failure class.

2026-08-29, live: a healthy multi-step GitHub job ended on the idle watchdog and
the app said "Served provider 'codex' exhausted; universe authority forbids
fallback widening." -- which reads as quota. The provider-routing spec
("the user notice reflects the true failure class, never mislabeling a timeout
as capacity") forbids exactly that.

    This asserted the VERBATIM exception for `provider_rate_limited`, on the
    grounds that a soft sentence would hide a real outage (Hard Rule 8). The
    concern is right and the conclusion no longer follows:

    * the raw text is "Served provider 'codex' exhausted; universe authority
      forbids fallback widening" -- the replacement names rate-limiting
      explicitly and says when to retry, so it is MORE specific, not softer;
    * this file's own docstring cites the spec, "the user notice reflects the
      true failure class". "Exhausted" for a rate limit is the mislabelling
      that spec forbids;
    * Hard Rule 8 targets failure dressed as success. This still reports
      failure, in words the owner can act on.

    The verbatim property survives for anything that is not our synthetic
    wrapper -- see `test_an_exception_without_a_failure_class_is_unchanged`,
    unchanged and passing.

    Live cost of the old behaviour: on 2026-09-01 the founder read "exhausted"
    and went to check his provider usage. It was fine; the real cause was a
    platform bug.
