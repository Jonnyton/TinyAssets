"""A node that went terminal must not launch provider work afterwards.

``_run_with_timeout`` submits every provider/source_code call to a shared
bounded ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` and measures ``timeout_s`` from ``submit()``,
not from worker-allocated start.  When the pool is saturated the 9th submit
sits in the queue burning its own deadline, ``NodeTimeoutError`` fires, the
node becomes terminal — and the queued work then *starts anyway*, holding a
worker and driving a provider call whose result nobody is waiting for.  That
is unadmitted work: it begins strictly after the deadline that admitted it.

The correction is bounded by what ``concurrent.futures`` can prove:

* **Not yet started** → ``Future.cancel()`` succeeds and the call never
  happens.  No provider was invoked, so there is no effect to settle and no
  uncertain-effect risk.
* **Already started** → ``Future.cancel()`` returns ``False`` by contract and
  the work runs to completion untouched.  Invocation settlement and
  uncertain-effect protection are preserved exactly as before; the worker
  thread is still never killed.

These tests pin both halves.  The first is the defect; the second is the
guard that the fix does not over-correct into interrupting live work.
