"""Fake the provider CLI launch at its explicit owned-process transport seam.

The Claude and Codex adapters no longer reach ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec``
or ``..._shell`` directly: every CLI is launched through
``tinyassets.providers.owned_process.aspawn_owned``. On POSIX that helper runs a
real wrapper/anchor handshake -- it execs a wrapper, waits for a status line on
a pipe, and parses the leader pid -- and **fails closed** with
``FamilyAnchorError`` when the handshake does not complete. A stand-in process
object cannot answer that handshake (no ``pid``, no wrapper, no status line), so
patching the ``asyncio`` spawn functions under it now produces anchor failures
rather than the adapter behaviour the test is about.

Tests that assert on *what the adapter builds and does with the stream* -- argv,
environment, cwd, auth classification, streaming, timeout/cancel teardown,
model selection, sandbox flags -- patch this seam instead. The argv is recorded
flattened (``recorder(*cmd, **kwargs)``), so ``call_args.args`` reads exactly as
it did against ``create_subprocess_exec(*cmd, **kwargs)``.

**This helper does not, and cannot, test ownership.** A fake transport proves
nothing about whether a real process family is ended: it never spawns one. Real
ownership stays proven by the real-process suites
(``tests/test_provider_real_adapter_deadline_reap.py`` and
``tests/test_provider_node_timeout_subprocess_reap.py``), which run the genuine
``aspawn_owned`` against genuine children and are deliberately untouched by
this module. Nothing here is autouse or global: each use is an explicit
context manager inside one test.
