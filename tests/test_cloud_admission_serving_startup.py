"""Serving-startup and origin-ingress admission.

OpenSpec change ``cloud-only-runtime-admission``, tasks 7 (origin backstop) and
8 (startup). Written against the tree **before** those guards exist, so every
negative here fails at the missing-refusal assertion on the unfixed tree and
passes once admission is wired. The positives assert preserved behaviour and
pass at baseline — which is what makes the negatives refusals rather than a
broken harness.

What each case defends:

* serving boot refuses NOT_CLOUD, an unobserved process and a *failed*
  resolution, with a non-zero exit — and reaches no maintenance, thread, worker,
  provider child, listener or storage writer on the way out;
* the session seal is still armed FIRST, before admission resolves anything;
* ``create_streamable_http_app`` is admitted in its own right, because it can be
  launched without ``main()`` (uvicorn factory, an embedding host, a test
  client), and admission precedes the writer barrier, storage initialization
  and the scheduler;
* an origin request reads only the **cached** verdict: a request never resolves
  provenance, and unknown/not-cloud never reaches a request handler;
* an admitted process serves exactly what it served before — same principal,
  same canary-only diagnostic, no anonymous release-state read.

Fixture-only. No real metadata service, no network, no provider child and no
production authority: every verdict here is an injected
``ProcessProvenanceObservation``, never an environment flag, and every
downstream boot action is replaced by a sentinel. A green run establishes no
cloud fact and no custody.
