"""A serving universe is never told it has no serving provider.

App thread, 2026-09-02. The founder's universe had a ready provider
assignment and a serving binding (chat and runs worked), and `get_status`
kept saying:

    consumer_pump: no_serving_runtime -- "This universe has no serving
    provider selected ... Choose one (registering a provider is not
    selecting it)."

Tiny planned around it ("cloud automation is not fully ready ... I do not
have the surface that flips the universe onto one"), and the app's heal
re-fired on every page load because it keys on that reason. The reason was
wrong: the consumer records `no_serving_runtime` whenever the fleet-era
executor selects no daemon, which since the fleet retirement is every
universe, serving or not.
