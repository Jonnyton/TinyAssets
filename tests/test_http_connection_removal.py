"""A deposited credential can be taken back — and the name is free afterwards.

`docs/concerns/2026-08-27-no-reachable-remove-for-http-connections.md`, filed
2026-08-27 and still true on 2026-08-31: `ConnectionLedger` had `revoke_grant`
and `revoke_connection`, and **no surface exposed either**. A user who pasted a
key — including one pasted against a host they did not intend — could not
withdraw it.

That concern also names the trap, which is why removal DELETES rather than
revokes. A connection id is deterministic on `(universe_id, destination)`, and
`connect_http` refuses any re-provision whose row has `revoked_at` set. So a
revoke-based remove burns the destination name forever: remove ``github`` and
you can never deposit ``github`` again. A remove you cannot undo is a trap, not
a remove — `test_the_destination_is_free_afterwards` is the test that says so.
