"""Guard: the platform holds no GitHub push credential.

Until 2026-09-24 the daemon could push to GitHub with a token the PLATFORM
held: a ``TINYASSETS_GITHUB_PUSH_CAPABILITIES`` (legacy
``TINYASSETS_GITHUB_PR_CAPABILITIES``) destination->token map in the host env
file, synced by the deploy from a repository secret and re-minted by a GitHub
App token refresher on a systemd timer. That path is cut. GitHub is a
connection a universe's owner may or may not have made; the platform never
pushes with a token of its own.

This test is red the moment any part of that path comes back: the map reader,
a code reader of the map names, a workflow that syncs or installs them, the
refresher and its units, or a compose / env-template entry. The entrypoint and
``deploy/retire_platform_llm_logins.sh`` are the only files allowed to name
the variables: the first strips them, the second deletes them from the host.
