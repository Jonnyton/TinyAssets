"""The boundary between USERS at the served tool surface.

Founder direction 2026-08-29: "other users shouldn't have access to affect each
other in that way" -- and, on seeing a draft that also changed how a universe
learns, "it's a separating-users architectural issue, not a change in how the
brains for each user works." So a universe keeps writing its own brain
(``write_brain``, the post-turn ``extract_learning`` -> ``commit_learning``) as
it learns from its founder and the world. What these tests lock down is the
other half: anything the universe reads that ANOTHER USER wrote arrives marked
as data, the persona prompt says what that mark means, and a governed file the
brain loop writes about the founder's organisation is read back founder-
privately.

Written for openspec/changes/brain-writes-carry-founder-provenance (narrowed).
