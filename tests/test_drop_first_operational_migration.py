"""Regressions for the two operational hazards the drop-first migration creates.

1. The env-apply helper reads the running daemon with a deliberately fail-open
   `|| true`. If the wrapper is absent (merge landed, image not deployed yet),
   that read returns "" and the caller mutates /etc/tinyassets/env and restarts
   the daemon on a false premise. The version preflight must therefore sit
   ABOVE that read and above every mutation, and must refuse without a restart
   and without a bare `docker exec ... printenv` fallback.

2. The compose healthcheck now needs a binary that ships with the image. That
   is only safe because deploy_fail_safe.sh restores the runtime bundle (which
   carries compose.yml) BEFORE it rolls the image back. Both rollback paths
   must keep that order.
