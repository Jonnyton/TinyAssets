"""The automation lease is per agent (branch), with a declared overlap policy.

Two agents in one universe run side by side; one agent never overlaps itself.
A due run whose agent is still running follows its row's ``overlap``: ``queue``
(the default, and every automation's behaviour under the old per-universe
lease), ``skip``, or ``cancel_previous``.

Driven through the real consumer (``poll_once``), the real due scan, the real
``run_due_automation`` and the real lease store. The only substitute is
``_execute``, the seam ``tinyassets.automations`` names for tests: it fakes
the graph a run executes, never the fence, the admission or the checks.
