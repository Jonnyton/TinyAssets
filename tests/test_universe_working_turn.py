"""Is this universe working right now? Read from the journal, scoped to the universe.

The web app had no way to ask. Its working indicator was a fact about the PAGE,
so a turn started by answering a request, by a queued line, from another window
or device, or one still running across a reload showed nothing at all (founder,
2026-09-26: turn ``d1a01eec`` ran 20:18:23Z to about 20:22Z with a blank screen).

Two properties this reader must hold, both of which a naive version gets wrong:

* UNIVERSE-scoped, not owner-scoped. ``agent_turns.owner_user_id`` is a provider
  capability principal, not the principal a served request's caller presents, so
  an owner match would answer "idle" during a live turn.
* A row older than the cap the coordinator already enforces is reported as
  ``stale``, never as activity and never hidden -- a killed container leaves one
  behind, and both painting it and dropping it silently are wrong.
