# TinyAssets state restore runbook

Use this procedure for whole-volume recovery, rollback after a bad migration,
or a fresh-host recovery drill. Nightly full archives are gzip files named
`tinyassets-data-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ.tar.gz`.

`deploy/backup-restore.sh` owns data restore only. It validates and stages the
archive before stopping containers, swaps the staged directory into place, and
retains the prior volume for rollback. It never starts a service.

## Preconditions

- Docker, rclone, Python 3, GNU tar, and `flock` are installed.
- `/etc/tinyassets/env` contains the configured `BACKUP_DEST`, unless restoring
  an already-downloaded archive with `BACKUP_FILE`.
- The repository is present at `/opt/tinyassets`.
- There is enough free space beside the Docker volume for the staged restore
  and retained pre-restore data.

Do not wipe or recreate the live volume. The restore script does not mutate it
until archive validation and staging have succeeded.

## Restore from the configured remote

```bash
set -a
. /etc/tinyassets/env
set +a

# Show only eligible full-volume archives.
sudo -E bash /opt/tinyassets/deploy/backup-restore.sh --list

# Confirm selection without mutation.
DRY_RUN=1 sudo -E bash /opt/tinyassets/deploy/backup-restore.sh

# Restore the newest full-volume archive.
sudo -E bash /opt/tinyassets/deploy/backup-restore.sh

# Or restore one exact UTC snapshot.
sudo -E bash /opt/tinyassets/deploy/backup-restore.sh \
  --timestamp=2026-07-23T03-00-00Z
```

## Restore an already-downloaded GitHub Release archive

`BACKUP_FILE` must be an absolute, readable, non-symlink regular-file path. It
bypasses rclone and remains caller-owned.

```bash
sudo -E env \
  BACKUP_FILE=/var/backups/tinyassets/tinyassets-data-2026-07-23T03-00-00Z.tar.gz \
  bash /opt/tinyassets/deploy/backup-restore.sh
```

Do not combine `BACKUP_FILE` with `--list` or `--timestamp`.

## What a successful restore does

The script:

1. Rejects an unreadable archive and any member that is absolute, traverses
   upward, is outside `_data`, is a symbolic/hard link, or is a special file.
2. Extracts the archive into a unique sibling stage with `_data` stripped,
   preserving dotfiles and nested files.
3. Acquires a non-blocking lock scoped to this resolved Docker volume.
4. Stops every running container that Docker reports as mounting the volume.
5. Renames the current `_data` to a unique retained sibling and moves the
   staged directory into `_data`.
6. Automatically puts the prior directory back if the second rename fails.

The final output prints the live path and retained pre-restore path. Record the
retained path before continuing.

## Start and verify separately

```bash
sudo systemctl start tinyassets-daemon
sudo systemctl status tinyassets-daemon --no-pager

python3 /opt/tinyassets/scripts/mcp_public_canary.py \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp --verbose
```

Only a green canary proves the restored daemon is usable. On a drill host, keep
the host available when the probe is red so the failure evidence survives.

## Remove retained data after a green canary

Set `OLD_DIR` to the exact path printed by the restore. Verify its shape before
removing it:

```bash
OLD_DIR=/var/lib/docker/volumes/tinyassets-data/.tinyassets-restore-old.REPLACE
case "${OLD_DIR}" in
  /var/lib/docker/volumes/*/.tinyassets-restore-old.*)
    sudo rm -rf -- "${OLD_DIR}"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "refusing unexpected OLD_DIR: ${OLD_DIR}" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

## Roll back after a red canary

Stop the daemon. Keep the failed restored directory as evidence, and move the
retained prior directory back:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop tinyassets-daemon

LIVE_DIR=/var/lib/docker/volumes/tinyassets-data/_data
OLD_DIR=/var/lib/docker/volumes/tinyassets-data/.tinyassets-restore-old.REPLACE
FAILED_DIR=/var/lib/docker/volumes/tinyassets-data/.tinyassets-restore-failed.$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)

case "${LIVE_DIR}|${OLD_DIR}|${FAILED_DIR}" in
  /var/lib/docker/volumes/*/_data\|/var/lib/docker/volumes/*/.tinyassets-restore-old.*\|/var/lib/docker/volumes/*/.tinyassets-restore-failed.*)
    sudo mv -- "${LIVE_DIR}" "${FAILED_DIR}"
    sudo mv -- "${OLD_DIR}" "${LIVE_DIR}"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "refusing unexpected restore paths" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

sudo systemctl start tinyassets-daemon
python3 /opt/tinyassets/scripts/mcp_public_canary.py \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp --verbose
```

## Common failures

- `archive member validation failed`: the live volume and containers have not
  been changed. Select another full archive.
- `restore already in progress`: another restore holds this volume's lock.
  Wait for it; restores of different volume directories use independent locks.
- `failed to stop all running volume consumers`: inspect
  `docker ps -a --filter volume=tinyassets-data`; no directory swap occurred.
- `failed to install staged volume`: the script attempted automatic rollback.
  Confirm `_data` contains the prior state and preserve any
  `.tinyassets-restore-old.*` directory before retrying.
- Disk full while staging: free space beside the volume or provision a larger
  disk. Do not stream-extract into the live volume; that bypasses validation
  and rollback.

The automated fresh-host proof is `.github/workflows/dr-drill.yml`. It
transfers a selected full archive, invokes this restore script, starts only the
daemon, probes through an SSH port forward, destroys a green drill host, and
keeps a red host by default.
