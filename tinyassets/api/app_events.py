"""``run_graph operation="emit_event"``: the owner's session wakes their own agent.

A screen the owner built (a custom UI) needs a way to start one of the owner's
agents -- "the baker was clicked" -- without being able to run anything it names.
This is that way: it emits an ``app_event`` with a NAME, and only an automation
the owner subscribed to that exact name wakes. Every cross-user rule is the
existing event path's (``automation_events.emit``): the verified request
principal, their own subscriptions, their own current home.

What the caller learns is how many wakes were stored, never which: a UI cannot
map an owner's subscriptions beyond "something listens to this name".
