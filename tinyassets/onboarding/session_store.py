"""Sealed server-side store for the app's AuthKit refresh tokens.

The onboarding app hands the browser an opaque *handle* and keeps the WorkOS
refresh token here.

**Sealed at rest.** Every record is AES-GCM ciphertext under a process key. The
AAD binds both the handle and the record kind, so a record copied onto another
handle's filename does not decrypt and a record's kind cannot be flipped by an
editor of the JSON. Nothing outside the ciphertext identifies a session: not the
token, and — this was the round-2 blocker — not the successor handle a rotation
points at either. A tombstone that named its successor in plaintext would have
handed a data-dir reader a *directly usable bearer handle*, which is the original
cross-user disclosure wearing a different hat.

**What this does and does not defend.** It defends against a reader of the *data
dir* that is not this process: a stray backup, a detached volume, a container
sidecar, a mounted-in tool, a restored snapshot. It is **not** a boundary against
code executing inside this process — that reader can call ``read()`` itself. That
is a separate, already-filed finding
(``docs/concerns/2026-08-28-user-code-runs-in-process.md``) whose fix is a process
split, and encryption must not be sold as a substitute for it. Likewise the
compose ``worker*`` fleet services mount ``/data`` and copy the environment; they
are being retired under ``openspec/changes/user-owned-automations`` and are
deliberately out of scope here.

**The key never reaches a child.** ``TINYASSETS_SESSION_SEAL_KEY`` is read and
popped from ``os.environ`` at **import time** (see ``arm()`` at the foot of this
module), not on first store use. Lazy loading left the key in the environment for
however long it took the first token request to arrive, and every provider child
spawned in that window inherits it: both
``tinyassets.providers.base.subprocess_env_without_api_keys`` and the no-universe
branch of the provider child env copy ``os.environ`` wholesale.
``tinyassets.universe_server.main()`` calls ``arm()`` as its first statement so
the scrub precedes the app build, the reconciler threads and uvicorn — the
onboarding route being dark (``TINYASSETS_ONBOARDING_APP`` off) must not leave the
key sitting in the environment.

**Handles rotate.** A refresh mints a NEW handle and replaces the old record with
a sealed tombstone naming the successor, expiring after a short grace. So a
captured handle stops working roughly one rotation after capture instead of
lasting the full 7-day TTL, and the retired token is not kept on disk at all.
The old handle follows exactly ONE hop during grace — long enough for a second
tab that lost the rotation race, short of walking a chain. A hop that lands on
another tombstone (two rotations inside the grace window) fails closed, so the
caller falls back to its cookie instead of presenting a token AuthKit retired.

The filename is a keyed digest of the handle, never the handle: the handle is a
bearer credential, so using it as a filename published every live session to
anything that could list the directory.
