"""Handoff behavior — declare / dry-run / prepare / execute / attest — plus the
``extensions`` dispatch table the canonical router half consumes.

Tasks 5.2 and 5.4 of
``openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-26-complete-independent-full-platform-targets`` (capability
``real-world-handoffs-and-outcomes``).

Public behavior composes under the canonical handle surface (design.md): these
are ``extensions`` *actions*, never new advertised MCP handles, and the
``extensions`` tool signature is NOT widened — every parameter reuses an existing
kwarg, the same technique the effector-consent and authoring actions use.

Router field reuse (also documented at the call site in
``tinyassets/api/extensions.py``):

=========================  ====================================================
``extensions`` kwarg       handoff meaning
=========================  ====================================================
``key``                    handoff_id
``run_id``                 source run that produced the declared output
``branch_version_id``      immutable source version carrying the declaration
``field_name``             declared output field
``project_id``             destination (checked against the declaration only)
``request_id``             confirmation token
``event_type``             outcome_kind
``status``                 target lifecycle state / evidence-level filter
``evidence_url``           evidence reference for an attestation
``outcome_id``             outcome claim id
``notes``                  attestation narrative
``payload_json``           action body (external_id, provider evidence)
``universe_id``            universe whose consent grants and receipts apply
``limit``                  list bound
=========================  ====================================================

Every handler returns a JSON string and never raises through the router: a
handoff error becomes ``{"error": ..., "code": ...}`` so a chatbot sees a
machine-readable rejection instead of a stack trace.

What this module deliberately does NOT do
-----------------------------------------

- **It does not transport anything.** The adapter registry
  (``tinyassets/handoffs/adapters.py``) is the only way out, and the exactly-once
  journal is the landed
  :func:`tinyassets.effectors.outbound_boundary.execute_replay_safe_effect`.
  There is no second receipt store, no second dedup identity, and no second
  credential path.
- **It does not inflate a claim.** :func:`record_evidence` accepts only
  non-inflating lifecycle transitions (``cancelled`` / ``rejected`` /
  ``orphaned``). Advancing a handoff *up* to ``accepted``/``verified`` requires
  provider-authenticated evidence, which is task 5.3's verification adapters —
  deferred in this lane, so the upgrade path is absent rather than faked.
