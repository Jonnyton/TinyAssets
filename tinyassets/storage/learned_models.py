"""One owner's own record of the model ids that have worked for them.

PERSONAL, and personal forever. A model id an owner typed and successfully used stays
on that owner's list and is never shared with anyone (founder, 2026-09-26). That single
rule is what makes this store safe, and it is why it is much smaller than it was:

* An account-bearing selector -- a Bedrock ARN with an account number in it, a personal
  deployment name -- can never leak, because nothing here is ever published.
* There is no cross-user table, no attestation, no confirmers, no pending state and no
  threshold. Three earlier designs tried to decide whether an id was safe to share:
  a charset (admitted ARNs, rejected real selectors), a distinct-owner threshold (two
  colleagues share one org's private id), and attestation plus peer confirmation
  (worked, but over-built for the problem). Sharing now happens somewhere else
  entirely, and by people: a reviewed file in the repo, see
  ``tinyassets/providers/public_model_lists.py``.

Why it exists at all: a source with no list-models endpoint offers only what its owner
typed, so without this an id that demonstrably worked vanished from the owner's own
picker the moment they stopped declaring it.

A row here is evidence an id WORKED FOR THIS OWNER, never permission to use it.
Serving still requires that universe's accepted model access.
