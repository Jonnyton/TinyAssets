"""Record-only platform runtime provenance observation.

OpenSpec change `cloud-only-runtime-admission`, task 4 (record-only slice).

**This module decides nothing on its own.** It resolves one bounded observation
— does the DigitalOcean droplet metadata service answer from inside this
process's machine, and does the id it reports equal the instance id the deploy
recorded before this process started — and it hands back a typed verdict.

Two callers now branch on that verdict (tasks 6-7): the assigned-claim CAS
predicate and cloud-worker runtime registration, through the admission helpers
at the bottom of this module. Serving startup, the provider-authority boundary
and the recovery paths are **still unchanged** — that is task 8 — so the
boundary is open, and the sanitized `enforced` / `mode` fields published on the
health read deliberately still report the record-only shape rather than
claiming a closed boundary this module cannot yet back.

What the verdict is, stated honestly
------------------------------------
An **accidental-start backstop**, never attestation. The metadata service is
unauthenticated and unsigned (`docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/metadata/`),
readable by any process inside the droplet, and forgeable by a local root
operator who adds a route or a listener. The deploy-recorded expected id is
copyable too. What the pair does establish is that a checkout, an env file, a
hostname, a container name or a compose label — all of which travel with a copy
of this repo — do not by themselves resolve to CLOUD. Absence, malformation,
timeout, redirect, oversize body and mismatch all resolve to not-cloud.

Design constraints this module is required to hold (design.md § Evidence
primitive, § Process lifetime and deployment ordering):

* One resolver function. The probe is a dedicated internal client on a literal
  link-local address with no redirects, no proxy inheritance, a sub-second
  timeout and no caller-supplied input. It never routes through the outbound
  HTTP/effect surface, so the SSRF driver's link-local classification stays
  exactly as it is, and it is not reachable as a user capability.
* Expected identity is read through the canonical CWD-independent data-root
  resolver (`tinyassets.storage.data_dir`), never from an environment variable,
  a hostname, a UUID or a container label.
* Comparison is a strict integer comparison of two bare numeric ids.
* The process-level observation is resolved at most once and is then immutable.
  A refusal never silently upgrades; a new process resolves independently.
* No database transaction is opened or held here, so no network I/O can ever run
  under the SQLite write lock. Callers that later gate a claim CAS must read the
  already-resolved process-owned value inside the transaction.
* There is no environment-variable bypass and no tests-only switch. Tests inject
  a reader/resolver, or construct their own observation object.
* The cached verdict is readable back through a **non-mutating peek** that never
  resolves, never initializes the cache and reports an explicit `unknown` for
  unobserved, failed or PID-inherited state. That is what lets a health `GET`
  report what this process already decided without becoming the thing that
  decides it (design.md § Reading the main process's cached observation back).
