"""Refuse a malformed public model list. CI moderation for agent-opened PRs.

A user's agent may open a PR adding a model id to ``models/<source-kind>.json`` like
any contributor. This is the mechanical half of the review: valid JSON, a known source
kind, well-formed identifiers, no duplicates, sorted. The judgement half is the lead
reading the PR, and there is deliberately no automatic merge path for these.

Exit 0 clean, 1 with findings. Every finding names the file and the reason.
