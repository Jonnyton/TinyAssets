"""Prove the public app URL is `https://tinyassets.io/app` and nothing else.

The app moved off `/mcp/app` on 2026-09-30 with no redirect (founder directive:
no back-compat). That makes the move's failure modes *edge* failures, which
green tests and a green daemon cannot see:

* `/app` never bound at the edge -> the apex website origin answers, so the URL
  looks alive and serves the wrong page (this is the 2026-04-19 P0 shape).
* `/app` bound as an EXACT route -> a Cloudflare route matches the whole URL
  including the query, so `/app?code=...&state=...` (the AuthKit return) and
  `/app?subscribed=1` (the Stripe return) match nothing and land on the website
  origin. The app shell loads; sign-in and billing are dark. No unit test can
  see this -- route-pattern semantics live at the edge.
* the `/app*` wildcard that fixes the above also captures apex assets whose path
  merely starts with `app`, e.g. `/apple-touch-icon.png`, which the Worker has
  to hand back to the website origin.
* `/mcp/app` still answering -> the move did not happen; installed shells keep
  working and nobody notices the split brain until the old path is pulled.
* `/app/*` API routes reachable anonymously -> the app left the `/mcp/` prefix
  the bearer challenge used to sweep, and took its auth boundary with it.

Each check names the observation that would refute it, so a failure says which
layer is wrong rather than "the app is down".

    python scripts/probe_app_surface.py
    python scripts/probe_app_surface.py --base-url https://tinyassets.io --verbose

Exit 0 only when every check passes. The MCP connector endpoint is NOT probed
here — `scripts/mcp_public_canary.py` owns that (Hard Rule 11).
