"""Auto-ship dry-run shipper — PR #198 Phase 1.

Pure-Python validator that runs a coding_packet (or constructed ship_request)
through the auto-ship safety envelope from
``docs/milestones/auto-ship-canary-v0.md`` §5.2, §6.1, §6.2, §6.3 and returns
a structured ship_decision explaining whether the packet WOULD ship, why,
and what rollback handle would be used.

Phase 1 contract: NO repo writes, NO IO, NO network. Validator only.
``ship_status`` is always ``"skipped"`` in this phase — the ``would_open_pr``
field tells callers whether the packet PASSED the envelope. Phase 2 (PR-open
mode) wires the actual repo operation behind a flag; Phase 3 enables
auto-merge for narrow canary classes after one successful PR-open round.

Pairs with:
- ``docs/specs/loop-outcome-rubric-v0.md`` (PR #211) — defines what KEEP +
  evidence-bundle-complete actually mean. The validator below enforces the
  envelope; the rubric defines what packets ARE before the envelope sees them.
- ``docs/milestones/auto-ship-canary-v0.md`` (PR #198) — milestone spec
  this module implements one phase of.

The shipper is the LAST enforcement layer. The release_gate may recommend
auto-ship; the shipper is what actually decides whether the recommendation
is safe enough to act on. Every check below is structural — no LLM in the
loop, no prose interpretation.
