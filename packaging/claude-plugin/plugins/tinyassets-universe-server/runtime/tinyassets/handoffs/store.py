"""Handoff lifecycle persistence, and the additive extension of the existing
``outcome_event`` registry.

Task 5.1 of ``openspec/changes/complete-independent-full-platform-targets``
(capability ``real-world-handoffs-and-outcomes``).

Where this lives, and why
-------------------------

Every table here is created in ``<data_dir>/.runs.db`` — the same database that
already holds ``outcome_event`` (``tinyassets/api/market.py`` resolves the
registry there), ``gate_events``, ``run_lineage``, and the attribution chain. It
is one database on purpose: an outcome claim, its evidence transitions, and the
handoff that produced it are written in a single transaction, and the base
``outcome_event`` row is created by the registry's own DDL owner
(:func:`tinyassets.outcomes.schema.migrate_outcome_schema`) rather than by a
copy of it here.

**This is an extension, not a second registry.** ``outcome_event`` remains the
sole generic owner of an outcome claim. ``outcome_evidence`` is a 1:1 side table
carrying the provenance and evidence-level columns the base table does not have,
and ``outcome_evidence_transition`` is its append-only journal. Their DDL and
legacy backfill live in ``tinyassets/outcomes/schema.py``; this store only
creates the handoff-owned tables and writes the registry transactionally.

Invariants this module owns
---------------------------

- **Owner scoping is in the SQL.** Every handoff read carries ``owner_id`` in its
  WHERE clause and a miss raises the single indistinguishable
  :class:`~tinyassets.handoffs.models.HandoffAccessError`, so a probe cannot
  tell "someone else's" from "does not exist".
- **One handoff per effect identity.** ``UNIQUE (effect_key, sink)`` mirrors the
  receipt store's primary key, so the lifecycle row and the receipt row cannot
  disagree about how many effects exist.
- **State advance is compare-and-swap, and the transition is written in the same
  immediate transaction.** A committed advance can never lose its transition, and
  ``seq`` stays contiguous.
- **Confirmations are single-use rows, not signed blobs**, so consumption is one
  atomic ``UPDATE ... WHERE consumed_at IS NULL`` and a replay cannot be forged.
- **Evidence transitions are append-only.** There is no UPDATE path that erases a
  prior level; the extension row's ``evidence_level`` is a cached head whose
  history is the transition table.
