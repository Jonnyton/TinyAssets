"""Common internal worker for a reserved run-owned execution envelope.

Not a public intake or a second queue. Origin adapters atomically reserve the
existing run and envelope, then supply a trusted current-authority preparer.
No caller-supplied graph/inputs are executed. All legacy delivery dispatch must
be fenced before moving that origin here. Managed invocation depends on the
cloud lane's validated `_execution_guard` seam; no unsafe compatibility fallback.
