"""stdio MCP server handed to ONE universe turn.

Launched by the `claude` CLI via ``--mcp-config`` + ``--strict-mcp-config``, so
the turn's entire MCP surface is this file and nothing else (verified live
2026-08-07: a competing project-tier ``.mcp.json`` in the pinned cwd does not
load).

    python -m tinyassets.universe_agent_server

The universe comes from the environment the DAEMON wrote into the config, never
from a tool argument. That is the whole security model in one sentence: the
model can say anything it likes, and none of it can name a different universe.

Deliberately not exposed here: the platform actions (agents, automations,
branches). Those authorise from request-scoped daemon state
(`permissions.is_authenticated_request()`), which a CLI-spawned subprocess does
not have — see `openspec/changes/universe-agent-hands/design.md`. They arrive
once the daemon-side route exists; asserting an identity from env here would be
the `UNIVERSE_SERVER_USER` mistake, where four security tests passed while
running as the resource owner.
