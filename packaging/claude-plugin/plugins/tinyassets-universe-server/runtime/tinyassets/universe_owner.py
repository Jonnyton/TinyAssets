"""Whose account a universe's bytes and seats are charged to.

Founder decision 2026-09-30: usage limits are ONE storage pool and ONE seat count
per PERSON, shared across all of their universes. That needs a fact the platform
did not store: which single account owns a universe. `universe_acl` cannot answer
it -- a shared universe has several admins, and "the admin who granted themselves"
is a correlation, not a record (memory `never-infer-identity-from-adjacent-tables`).

So ownership is written by exactly two things, and read by one resolver pair:

* the transaction that CREATES a universe (`record_creation`), in the same commit
  as the creator's admin grant -- so no universe is ever born granted but unowned;
* a one-time backfill from `founder_home` (`backfill_from_founder_home`) for
  universes that predate this table. `founder_home` is an explicit identity
  binding. Nothing else is backfilled: every other pre-existing universe stays
  UNATTRIBUTED -- counted on host-only surfaces, never refused -- until an owner
  is known (founder decision 2026-09-30, account-storage-quota Q2).

`owner_of` / `tier_of` are the ONLY resolvers. Seats and storage both call them;
a second pair would be a second definition of one fact.
