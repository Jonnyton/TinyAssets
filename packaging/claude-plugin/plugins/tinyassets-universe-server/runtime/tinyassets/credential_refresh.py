"""The ONE refresh core for every vault credential that rotates its secret.

Two stores in this repo hold a refreshable OAuth credential for one universe: an
``http`` record whose token is the ``oauth2`` bundle
(:mod:`tinyassets.connection_oauth.tokens`), and an ``llm_subscription`` record
whose document is the CLI's own ``auth.json``
(:func:`tinyassets.onboarding.openai_device.build_codex_auth_json`). Both spend a
single-use refresh token, so both need the same five things in the same order --
and the order is the whole of the correctness:

1. the per-credential THREAD lock, so one process refreshes once;
2. the per-credential FILE lock, so one HOST refreshes once;
3. the vault's exclusive admission, taken BEFORE anything is spent. The
   cross-process admission is bounded (on Windows it gives up after about a
   second), so a refresh that took it only to WRITE could rotate the secret at
   the provider and then fail to save it, losing the credential entirely;
4. a RE-READ inside those locks -- the holder before us may already have
   rotated, and staleness is re-decided on what was just read rather than on
   what the caller saw;
5. the write, while the vault is still held.

This module owns that ordering and nothing else. It does not know either
encoding: the caller supplies four pure functions (read / stale / spend /
records) and how it reports a failure. A base class with two subclasses was the
alternative, and it would have put the ordering in a template method -- inviting
an override of exactly the part that must not vary.

Nothing here logs, returns, or formats a secret. The caller's ``spend`` is
responsible for scrubbing the token endpoint's own words before they reach a
:class:`RefreshRejected` detail.
