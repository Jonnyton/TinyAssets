"""The owner's read of their own universe folder (``/u``) from the connector.

Agents a universe runs coordinate through files in ``/u`` -- a board, a queue, a
log -- and until now only the universe's OWN served tools could read them. A
screen the owner built (a custom UI, through its bridge) or the owner's own
chatbot had no way to see them. These are the two reads that close that gap:
one directory listing and one bounded file read.

Owner-only, deliberately narrower than "can read the universe": a public
universe is readable by anyone, and its public face is not its working folder.
The gate is the same one pending requests use -- an explicit ``admin`` ACL row
for this actor on this universe -- and every refusal, a missing file and a path
that tries to leave the folder all return one ``not_found`` envelope, so the
read cannot be used to learn whether a universe or a path exists.

Paths never leave the folder: every component is checked, and the reads go
through ``tinyassets.universe_files``, which opens each component without
following a link.
