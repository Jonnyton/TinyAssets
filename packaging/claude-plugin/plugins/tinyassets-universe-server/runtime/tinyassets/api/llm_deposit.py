"""Owner-scoped BYO-LLM subscription deposit.

The chatbot deposit path for the ``byo-llm-deposit-surface`` capability:
``write_graph target=connection operation=connect_llm``. An authenticated
universe **owner/founder** places their own Claude or Codex subscription material
into that universe's credential vault as a single owned ``llm_subscription``
record, so the downstream custody/serving spine can serve on it.

This handler is the canonical ``llm_subscription`` vault writer. It performs only
the owner-scoped vault write; custody adoption and the serving re-point stay in
``bind_serving_provider`` (owned by ``byo-llm-provider-connect``). It adds no new
advertised MCP handle — it is an operation under the pinned ``write_graph``.

Security honesty (MVP, chatbot transport): the base64 ``auth_material_b64`` the
caller submits unavoidably enters the MCP request and the model/connector context
on the chatbot path, and the decoded Claude token is stored in the per-universe
vault, which is 0600 JSON and **not** encrypted at rest (credential-vault task
1.8). The secure browser transport (``byo-llm-deposit-browser-form``) removes the
chat-context exposure and is a prerequisite before any multi-tenant (second-user)
use. Beyond that inherent transport exposure, this handler never returns, logs, or
echoes the material, and its exceptions carry no secret.
