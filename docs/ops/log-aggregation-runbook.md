# Log Aggregation Runbook

TinyAssets uses a layered logging strategy on the self-hosted Droplet:

| Layer | Tool | What it does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Collection | Vector sidecar (`deploy/vector.yaml`) | Receives daemon, tunnel, and slack-agent stdout from Docker's async Fluent driver on host-loopback port 24224; has no Docker socket; re-emits everything on its own stdout |
| **Durable, on-box** | **the host journal** | The `logs` container uses the `journald` driver (`deploy/compose.yml`), so Vector's re-emitted stream is journal data and **survives container recreates**. Retention: `deploy/journald-tinyassets.conf`, a drop-in the host-uptime installer owns |
| Real-time (optional) | Better Stack | Vector also ships live when `BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN` is set |
| Offsite archiving | `deploy/ship-logs.sh` + systemd timer | Pulls last 24 h of container logs, archives as `.tar.gz`, uploads to `LOG_DEST` (Hetzner Storage Box or DO Spaces), prunes archives older than 30 days |

**Why the journal is the durable layer (2026-09-26).** It used to be the `logs`
container's own json-file, which lives under `/var/lib/docker/containers/<id>/`
and is deleted with the container. Every deploy recreates the daemon, and
`deploy/deploy_fail_safe.sh` force-recreates `tinyassets-logs` whenever a Vector
input changes. On 2026-09-26 a live latency investigation needed the per-attempt
`latency_ms` lines from turns six minutes earlier and they no longer existed
anywhere (`docs/concerns/2026-09-26-daemon-logs-not-shipped.md`).

Two claims that were in this repo and were **wrong**, corrected here: `compose.yml`
and `tinyassets-env.template` both said logs were "captured by journald" via
compose stdout. `docker compose up -d` detaches, so a container's stdout goes to
its logging driver, never to the systemd unit that ran compose.

> **`LOG_DEST` is still unset in production, so the offsite row below still ships
> nothing.** That is tracked separately and is not fixed by this change — what is
> fixed is that the evidence now survives on the box long enough to be collected.

## Setup

### 1. Better Stack (optional, recommended)

1. Create a free account at `logs.betterstack.com`.
2. Create a new **Source** → **HTTP** type.
3. Copy the ingest token.
4. Add to `/etc/tinyassets/env`:

```
BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

5. Reload the logs sidecar:

```bash
docker compose -f /opt/tinyassets/deploy/compose.yml restart logs
```

Logs from the daemon, tunnel, and workers will appear in Better Stack within seconds.

### 2. Offsite archive via ship-logs.sh

`ship-logs.sh` uses rclone. Each archive includes `fleet-manifest.tsv` with the exact container ID, state, and log filename for the daemon, tunnel, and four workers. Logs are read by immutable ID and the name-to-ID mapping is rechecked, so a concurrent Compose recreation fails the run instead of silently mixing generations. Stopped containers are included; a missing container or unreadable log also fails before upload. The script and timer are installed through the content-addressed host-uptime release after every successful production deploy. Configure the same remote as Row J backups (see `docs/ops/backup-restore-runbook.md`).

Add to `/etc/tinyassets/env`:

```
# rclone URL for log archives — can share the same remote as backups
LOG_DEST=sftp:storagebox/tinyassets-logs
# or for DO Spaces:
# LOG_DEST=s3:tinyassets-logs/logs
```

Install the systemd units (ship-logs + disk-watch together):

```bash
cp /opt/tinyassets/deploy/tinyassets-ship-logs.service  /etc/systemd/system/
cp /opt/tinyassets/deploy/tinyassets-ship-logs.timer    /etc/systemd/system/
cp /opt/tinyassets/deploy/tinyassets-disk-watch.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp /opt/tinyassets/deploy/tinyassets-disk-watch.timer   /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now tinyassets-ship-logs.timer tinyassets-disk-watch.timer
```

Verify the timers are scheduled:

```bash
systemctl list-timers tinyassets-ship-logs.timer tinyassets-disk-watch.timer
```

**Disk-watch** (`scripts/disk_watch.py`) fires hourly at minute27 (also shortly
after boot) and opens a `disk-pressure` GH Issue when the verified image-store
filesystem reaches `DISK_WARN_PCT` (default
80%). Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `/etc/tinyassets/env` with `issues: write` scope.
Optional env vars: `DISK_WATCH_PATH`, `DISK_WARN_PCT`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.

Both automatic cleanup services use bounded daemon-image retention, not system,
builder, journal, volume or container cleanup. The compatibility command
`python3 scripts/disk_autoprune.py` defaults to dry-run; both `--apply` and exact
`TINYASSETS_DAEMON_IMAGE_RETENTION_APPLY=1` are required for exact non-force removals
after all protection/recovery checks. Timer installation alone cannot enable it.
Run the helper directly for acceptance: the chained service also runs ordinary
transcript rotation, which this flag does not affect. Containerd image
storage needs an operator-verified `TINYASSETS_IMAGE_RETENTION_STORAGE_PATH`.
See the [retention rollout checklist](../../openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-19-daemon-image-retention/operator-acceptance.md)
before installing or activating the updated cleanup units. Unknown mapping or
protected-image evidence is a refusal, not permission for broad prune.

## Daily Operations

### Query today's logs (live on Droplet)

```bash
# Vector's local forwarded stream (daemon, tunnel, and workers)
docker logs tinyassets-logs --since 1h
docker logs tinyassets-logs -f
```

### Query via journald — this is the one that survives a deploy

```bash
# Every forwarded line from every container, across past container recreates.
journalctl CONTAINER_NAME=tinyassets-logs --since "1 hour ago"

# Microsecond timestamps — needed for per-attempt latency evidence.
journalctl CONTAINER_NAME=tinyassets-logs --output=short-iso-precise \
  --since "2026-09-26 18:10" --until "2026-09-26 18:20"

# One originating container: the JSON payload carries Vector's `tag`/`role`.
journalctl CONTAINER_NAME=tinyassets-logs -o cat | grep '"role":"daemon"'

# The systemd unit that runs compose — the supervisor's own output, NOT the
# containers' (`docker compose up -d` detaches).
journalctl -u tinyassets-daemon --since "1 hour ago"
```

`docker logs tinyassets-logs` also still works, because journald is a readable
driver — but it is scoped to the current container, so prefer `journalctl` when
the question spans a deploy.

### Journal retention (no host action — the installer owns it)

`deploy/journald-tinyassets.conf` is installed to
`/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/tinyassets.conf` by
`deploy/install-host-uptime-services.sh`, which runs after every successful
production deploy and restarts `systemd-journald` only when the bytes changed.
`Storage=persistent`, `SystemMaxUse=1G`, `MaxRetentionSec=14day`,
`SystemKeepFree=2G`, rate limiting off — a dropped message during an incident is
the evidence this exists to keep.

Change it there, not on the box, or the next install reverts it.

```bash
journalctl --disk-usage
cat /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/tinyassets.conf
```

### Query from Better Stack

1. Log in at `logs.betterstack.com`.
2. Filter by source or by metadata field `.service = "tinyassets"`.
3. Use `.role = "daemon"` or `.role = "cloudflared"` to scope to one container.
4. Date-range picker selects the archive window.

Better Stack free tier retains 3 GB / month — sufficient for a single daemon running at normal load.

## Pull a Date Range from Offsite Archives

Archives are named `tinyassets-logs-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.tar.gz` and stored at `LOG_DEST`.

### List available archives

```bash
rclone lsf --format "tp" "${LOG_DEST}/"
```

### Download and inspect a specific archive

```bash
# Download
rclone copyto "${LOG_DEST}/tinyassets-logs-2026-04-20T02-00-00.tar.gz" /tmp/

# Extract
mkdir /tmp/log-restore
tar -xzf /tmp/tinyassets-logs-2026-04-20T02-00-00.tar.gz -C /tmp/log-restore

# Inspect
ls /tmp/log-restore/
grep "ERROR" /tmp/log-restore/tinyassets-daemon.log
```

### Pull a date range (multiple archives)

```bash
# List archives between two dates
rclone lsf --format "tp" "${LOG_DEST}/" | grep "2026-04-1[5-9]"

# Download all of them
rclone copy --include "tinyassets-logs-2026-04-1*.tar.gz" "${LOG_DEST}/" /tmp/log-range/
```

## Manual Offsite Push

To trigger an ad-hoc archive (e.g. before a deploy):

```bash
LOG_DEST="${LOG_DEST}" LOG_SINCE=4h bash /opt/tinyassets-host-uptime/current/deploy/ship-logs.sh
```

Dry-run to confirm env without touching anything:

```bash
DRY_RUN=1 LOG_DEST="${LOG_DEST}" bash /opt/tinyassets-host-uptime/current/deploy/ship-logs.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No logs in Better Stack | Token not set or wrong | Check `BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN` in `/etc/tinyassets/env`; restart `logs` container |
| Vector container not running | Depends-on daemon unhealthy | Check `docker logs tinyassets-logs`; confirm daemon healthcheck passes. While it is down the fluentd driver buffers in memory and then **drops** — the journal gets nothing, so fix this first |
| `journalctl CONTAINER_NAME=tinyassets-logs` is empty | The `logs` container is not on the journald driver (compose drift) | `docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}' tinyassets-logs` must print `journald`; if not, the deployed compose.yml is behind `deploy/compose.yml` |
| Journal history shorter than 14 days | Drop-in missing, or `SystemMaxUse` hit | `cat /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/tinyassets.conf`; `journalctl --disk-usage`. Absent drop-in means the installer has not run since the change landed |
| Journal empties on reboot | `Storage` is not persistent | `/var/log/journal` must exist; the drop-in sets `Storage=persistent` and journald creates it on restart |
| ship-logs.sh exits 1 | `LOG_DEST` missing, a required container missing, or its logs unreadable | Set `LOG_DEST`; then inspect `docker ps -a` and `docker logs <container>` for every required fleet member |
| rclone upload fails | Remote misconfigured | Run `rclone lsd "${LOG_DEST}/"` to test connectivity |
| Archives not being pruned | Clock skew or naming mismatch | Check archive names match `tinyassets-logs-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.tar.gz` pattern |
| `docker logs` shows nothing | Container hasn't started | `docker ps -a` to check container state |

---

## Retention Policy

| Storage | Retention | Where |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Docker fluentd driver buffer | In-memory; **drops** while Vector is down (`docs/concerns/2026-09-26-fluentd-driver-drops-while-vector-is-down.md`) | Not durable, never evidence |
| **host journal** | **1 G / 14 days, persistent** (`deploy/journald-tinyassets.conf`) | Droplet local disk, survives container recreates |
| Better Stack | 3 GB/month (free tier) | Better Stack cloud |
| Offsite archive | 30 days | `LOG_DEST` (Hetzner/DO Spaces) |

To adjust offsite retention, set `LOG_RETAIN_DAYS` in `/etc/tinyassets/env`.
