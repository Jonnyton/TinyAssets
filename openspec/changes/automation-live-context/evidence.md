Environment: TinyAssets Linux scratch repository workspace, Python 3 at `/usr/bin/python3`. Stored build/test run: `c2f93cd070ba4c57` in tiny's private universe.

- `python3 tests/test_automation_live_context.py -v`: 16 tests passed.
- `python3 -m py_compile tinyassets/automation_context.py tinyassets/automations.py`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `python3 scripts/openspec_flow.py audit`: passed.
- `python3 scripts/openspec_flow.py check-change automation-live-context --provider codex`: ALLOWED.

`pytest`, `ruff`, `openspec`, `claude`, and `codex` executables are absent in this workspace. Existing scheduler regressions and cross-family review are pending; no live scheduler activation or continuous execution is claimed. No platform code was merged or deployed in this verification.

Follow-up: regenerated the plugin mirror. All six pre-commit invariants pass, including mirror parity for 397 files. The local plugin import probe remains unavailable because uvicorn is absent; CI must run that probe.
