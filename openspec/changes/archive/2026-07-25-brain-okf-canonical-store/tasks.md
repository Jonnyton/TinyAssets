> **Lane disposition — CLOSED 2026-07-25. The 2026-07-24 sweep below was correct; its blocker cleared and the change reached its terminal state by the sequence that sweep prescribed.**
> The host answered the "Resolve target-spec PLAN conflicts" decision batch on 2026-07-25, unblocking 2.1. Executed in the prescribed order: **2.1 PLAN foldback → 4.1 discharged by relocation → §5 relocated to the successor change `build-brain-canonical-store` → 4.3 archive with `--skip-specs`.**
> This change never reaches 16/16 and still should not: §5 is build work it excluded by its own heading, and it archives with those boxes honestly unchecked. It **did** discharge every obligation it actually owned.
> **What did NOT change:** `openspec/specs/` is as-built truth and `brain-canonical-store` remains entirely unbuilt (no `tinyassets/brain/`, no bundle write path, no outbox). The host decision resolved the PLAN gate, not the as-built gate — so 4.1's *sync* was never performed. The delta now lives in `openspec/changes/build-brain-canonical-store/`, which syncs it when the build lands.
> **Cross-family gates:** 2026-07-24 — Codex asked to refute the blocking analysis, returned `confirmed`. 2026-07-25 — Codex asked to refute "4.1 must not be a literal sync even after host approval; relocate instead and archive `--skip-specs`", returned `REFUTED: no` with the same recommendation.

## 1. Establish the active change as the behavioral target owner

- [x] 1.1 Record the conflicting SQLite-canonical and markdown-canonical legacy statements as provenance
- [x] 1.2 Record the 2026-06-24 host directive in the proposal and design
- [x] 1.3 Keep the OpenSpec delta as the sole in-flight behavioral target owner
- [x] 1.4 Remove any requirement to amend legacy `docs/specs/` files as authority
- [x] 1.5 Carry source-of-truth, redaction, build-boundary, and backup behavior in the delta/design
- [x] 1.6 Cite the OKF source and `okf_version "0.1"` as provenance for the target

## 2. Companion + coordination alignment

- [x] 2.1 With host approval, fold the accepted store/redaction/build-boundary/backup architecture into PLAN before implementation or spec sync
  > **DONE 2026-07-25 — host-approved, then folded.** The host answered the STATUS `host-decision` row "Resolve target-spec PLAN conflicts — store, private data, primitives, privacy guidance" on 2026-07-25; all four positions are now in `PLAN.md`, each marked host-approved with that date. All four D6 items landed in the **Brain Module** under "Canonical store": *source of truth* (OKF bundle canonical, SQLite/FTS/vectors a rebuildable index, bundle wins on conflict, typed fields as additional frontmatter keys), *redaction ordering* (block the operational index FIRST, then delete the bundle body, then rebuild and purge rollups; secrets-class tombstone omits any recoverable content hash), *build boundary* (conformance validation `[substrate]`, upstream-watch steward `[composable]`), and *backup* (the nightly git snapshot IS the canonical store, not a backup of a DB; wholesale portable export). The block is stamped architecture-only, since no bundle write path is built.
  > **Scoping recorded alongside it:** Design Decisions now scopes Postgres-canonical to catalog/ledger/inbox/market and makes the OKF bundle canonical for the commons, with a user's brain organization user-designable and remixable (OKF is the *default*, not a mandate); Open Tensions' "largest unresolved architectural decision" line is rewritten as resolved-by-scoping. Contradictions were deleted, not layered — the Brain and Cross-Cutting "no single backend owns truth" lines now distinguish canonical source from retrieval routing.
- [x] 2.2 Keep STATUS dependencies explicit so no Brain implementation treats the legacy narrative or research companion as authority
  > **Discharged in two halves (verified 2026-07-24).** *Legacy-is-not-authority:* landed independently — `docs/specs/INDEX.md` now disclaims current authority for the whole directory, and `docs/audits/2026-07-22-legacy-spec-disposition.md` classifies `2026-06-10-brain-v2-research-implications.md` as **HISTORY** ("`brain-okf-canonical-store` owns the unbuilt OKF migration", line 67) and `2026-06-10-tiny-first-principles-spec.md` as **CLAIMED**, split across canonical specs / active Brain changes / the PLAN host-decision lane (line 69). *Dependency-is-explicit:* the STATUS `host-decision` row now names the store decision's gated consumers (this change's 2.1 foldback and 4.1 sync) inline, so a provider reading STATUS sees the block without opening the change. Coalesced into the existing row rather than added as a new one — STATUS is at its 60-line hard ceiling and already over its byte ceiling (`python scripts/check_context_budget.py`), and AGENTS.md requires duplicate host asks be coalesced to one.

## 3. Cross-provider review gate (MUST precede any build-gating)

- [x] 3.1 Codex review pass obtained — verdict **ADAPT** (`docs/audits/2026-06-24-brain-okf-canonical-codex-review.md`); 6 required adaptations
- [x] 3.2 Folded all 6 adaptations into the spec delta + design + proposal; legacy documents remain non-authoritative provenance:
  - [x] 3.2.1 Commit protocol replaces "write-through resolves Gap #4" (spec Req 2; design D2; proposal)
  - [x] 3.2.2 `log.md` (human history) split from the transactional journal/outbox (spec "Reserved files" Req; design D2)
  - [x] 3.2.3 OKF compatibility shim — wiki not conformant as-is (spec "compatibility shim" Req; design D5; proposal slice-1)
  - [x] 3.2.4 Build-boundary: conformance validation = `[substrate]`; upstream-watch steward = `[composable]` (spec requirement; design D4)
  - [x] 3.2.5 Redaction: block operational index FIRST; secrets tombstone omits content-hash (spec requirement)
  - [x] 3.2.6 Reword inconsistency → cross-artifact mismatch; SHOULD-not-MUST key preservation; broken-link wording (proposal Why; design Context; spec Req 3)

## 4. OpenSpec fold-back

- [x] 4.1 `sync-specs`: merge the `brain-canonical-store` delta into `openspec/specs/brain-canonical-store/spec.md` (after host merge key)
  > **DISCHARGED 2026-07-25 BY RELOCATION — the sync itself was deliberately NOT performed. Read this before assuming `openspec/specs/brain-canonical-store/` exists: it does not.**
  > Of the three gates on this task, two cleared and one did not:
  > 1. *Host merge key* — cleared long ago. PR #1369 **MERGED** 2026-06-25 (merge commit `95d63682`, an ancestor of `origin/main`).
  > 2. *Gate ordering inside this change* — **cleared 2026-07-25.** 2.1's PLAN foldback is done, so the D6 "PLAN before sync" ordering is satisfied.
  > 3. *`openspec/specs/` is as-built truth* — **still blocking, and the host decision did not address it.** AGENTS.md §"Spec-driven development" defines `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` as as-built requirement truth, and re-verified 2026-07-25: no file under `openspec/specs/` declares itself target-state, while `paid-market-economy` and `distributed-execution` both explicitly describe only landed behavior *including its limitations*. `brain-canonical-store` is entirely unbuilt — no `tinyassets/brain/` package, no bundle write path, no commit protocol, no outbox. Syncing would assert requirements the system does not satisfy.
  >
  > **What was done instead:** the delta is relocated (all six Codex adaptations intact) into the successor change `openspec/changes/build-brain-canonical-store/`, which owns the build and syncs the capability when — and only when — the behavior ships. The delta keeps a live owner; the as-built spec surface stays truthful. The copy under this change archives as its historical record. **Updated 2026-07-25:** the relocation was verbatim at the moment of archiving, but the successor's delta has since taken one scoping correction (Codex `ADAPT` finding 1 — source-of-truth and OKF-conformance scoped to the commons and the default brain organization rather than every brain), so the two copies are no longer byte-identical. The frozen copy here is the historical record; the successor is the live target.
  > **Cross-family gate 2026-07-25:** Codex (read-only, `codex exec`) was asked to **refute** the claim that 4.1 must not be a literal sync even after host approval, and returned **`REFUTED: no`** — citing AGENTS.md:194, the absent `tinyassets/brain/`, and `openspec/specs/knowledge-retrieval-and-memory/spec.md:388-444` disclaiming canonical-store authority — recommending exactly this relocation plus `--skip-specs` archive.
- [x] 4.2 Draft PR opened — #1369 (merge to `main` still host-key gated; production-impacting)
  > Landed: merged 2026-06-25T07:27:22Z as `95d63682` (`gh pr view 1369`). The trailing "still host-key gated" clause is historical wording, now stale.
- [x] 4.3 Archive the change after merge
  > **DONE 2026-07-25 via `openspec archive brain-okf-canonical-store --yes --skip-specs`.** `--skip-specs` is load-bearing, not a convenience: `openspec archive` syncs delta specs as a side effect, and that side effect is precisely the sync 4.1 established must not happen yet. Both of this task's original preconditions are now met — §5 is owned (relocated to `build-brain-canonical-store`) and the delta has a live home, so this is no longer "an archived change with unbuilt, unrelocated requirements."
  > Prescribed sequence executed in order: host store decision → 2.1 PLAN foldback → 4.1 discharged by relocation → §5 relocated → 4.3 archive.

## 5. Future build — RELOCATED 2026-07-25 to `build-brain-canonical-store` (tasks 2.1–2.3)

> **These three boxes stay unchecked on purpose, forever. They are unbuilt, and this change archives that way.** §5 was out of scope for this change by its own heading; checking them off without the build would be a false completion claim, and archiving does not change what the code does.
>
> **Successor:** `openspec/changes/build-brain-canonical-store/` now owns them — 5.1 → its 2.1, 5.2 → its 2.2, 5.3 → its 2.3, plus a new 2.4 for the `tinyassets/brain/` package they all need, and a 3.1 that performs the spec sync once the behavior exists. The verified partial-landing notes below were carried across verbatim so the successor's builder reuses shipped code instead of rebuilding it. The open design questions from `design.md` moved with them.
>
> Premise re-verified against the tree 2026-07-24 (`origin/main` @ `6dd2bdf0`), re-confirmed 2026-07-25, so a future builder does not rebuild shipped code:

- [ ] 5.1 OKF compatibility shim (wikilink→Markdown projection; root-`index.md`→`okf_version`-only; `log.md` normalization; `drafts/` bundle-vs-staging rule)
  > **PARTIALLY LANDED — in the opposite direction. Reuse, do not rebuild.** `tinyassets/wiki/okf_export.py` ships all four projection mechanics, as a one-way *export* of curated wiki pages into a fresh bundle: `_convert_wikilinks` (resolvable wikilinks → absolute bundle links; unresolved rendered as plain labels and reported), `_write_index` (root `index.md` frontmatter is `okf_version: "0.1"` and nothing else — `okf_export.py:199`), `_write_log` (dated `log.md`), and `_EXCLUDED_ROOTS = {"drafts", "raw", "daemon-wiki"}` (`okf_export.py:15`) — which is a *de facto* answer to the `drafts/` question left open in `design.md`: drafts are operational staging outside the bundle. This is already as-built spec truth in `openspec/specs/knowledge-retrieval-and-memory/spec.md:386,404`, whose own wording is careful that it is "not complete upstream OKF conformance or canonical-store authority".
  > **Still unbuilt:** the D5 *read-path* shim — consuming the existing wiki **in place** for slice-1 `assemble(lens)`. The exporter writes a separate bundle and refuses a target inside the source root (`okf_export.py:38`); it is not an in-place reader. `assemble(lens)` does not exist (`tinyassets/` has no `brain/` package; the only `assemble_*` functions are unrelated retrieval helpers). Task stays unchecked.
- [ ] 5.2 Write commit protocol (idempotency key; pending→durable states; atomic temp+rename; outbox ordering; crash recovery; rebuild reconciliation)
  > **Wholly unbuilt — no partial credit.** No bundle write path, outbox, or entry-state machine exists anywhere in `tinyassets/`. The shipped exporter is read-only by construction (`okf_export.py:1`; it "MUST NOT add an MCP action or mutate the source wiki" per the as-built spec), so nothing here is started.
- [ ] 5.3 Conformance validation `[substrate]` + `okf_version` pin + composable upstream-watch steward
  > **Split verdict.** *Partially landed:* the `okf_version` pin exists (`OKF_VERSION = "0.1"`, `okf_export.py:12`) and a structural conformance validator ships (`_conformance_report`, `okf_export.py:232` — validates reserved-file shapes and parseable concept frontmatter with non-empty `type`). But it is deliberately narrow: it validates only the *generated* bundle, and the as-built spec states its `conformant` flag "does not claim complete upstream OKF or canonical-store conformance". *Unbuilt:* substrate-wide conformance validation over a canonical bundle, and the composable upstream-watch steward — a repo-wide search finds no OKF steward in any module or workflow. Task stays unchecked.
