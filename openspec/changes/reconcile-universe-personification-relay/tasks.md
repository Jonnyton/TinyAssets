## 1. Verify the contradiction (done in this change)

- [x] 1.1 `git fetch --prune`; classify against `origin/main`, then re-verify at `7a118dca` after PR #1578
- [x] 1.2 Confirm source 1 — ratified correction: PR #1578 / `f605bb99` replaces chatbot embodiment with the relay model
- [x] 1.3 Confirm source 2 — `docs/design-notes/2026-07-02-universe-intelligence-relay-architecture.md` §3 (why embodiment was live-falsified)
- [x] 1.4 Confirm source 3 — shipped code: `tinyassets/universe_server.py:209` ("You do NOT speak as the universe … RELAY … RENDER")
- [x] 1.5 Confirm the landed as-built capability `openspec/specs/universe-personification-and-relay/spec.md` codifies relay
- [x] 1.6 Find the **fourth** stale source, then verify PR #1578 / `f605bb99` corrected it before this reconciliation lands

## 2. Classify the 11 unchecked tasks (done — `design.md` §"Task-by-task reconciliation")

- [x] 2.1 Classify each task reversed / survives / already landed / unclear, one-line reason each
- [x] 2.2 Verify every "already landed" claim against `origin/main` code with a file citation (2.2-instructions, 2.7-honest-fallback, 2.3-grounded-assembly)
- [x] 2.3 Verify every "survives, unbuilt" claim by confirming absence in `tinyassets/` (no `identity_tier`; no dossier-write rejection)
- [x] 2.4 Flag task 4.1 (`sync-specs`) as MUST-NOT-RUN with the specific damage named

## 3. Retire the reversed change without deleting it

- [x] 3.1 `SUPERSEDED` banner on `universe-personification/proposal.md`, `design.md`, and the delta spec
- [x] 3.2 Rewrite `universe-personification/tasks.md` with per-task classification inline, so the file itself answers "should I build this?"
- [x] 3.3 Archive to `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-22-universe-personification/` (removes it from `openspec list`; preserves every artifact)

## 4. Carry surviving intent forward

- [x] 4.1 Seven ADDED requirements on `universe-personification-and-relay`, covering every surviving retired requirement (whole-mind speaking surfaces; authorization-before-voice; interlocutor tier binding; narrowed anti-collision boundary; forkable first-party persona; one learned identity across surfaces; Tiny as governed platform personification)
- [x] 4.2 Remove the threshold-less 2.9 scenario from this delta; carry connector instruction-density vs tool-selection accuracy as definition task 6.3 against `live-mcp-connector-surface`
- [x] 4.3 Cross-reference `universe-visibility` (anonymous-reader semantics) and `brain-okf-canonical-store` (assembled-view content) instead of duplicating them

## 5. Gates

- [x] 5.1 Opposite-provider review dispatched to Codex (background `scripts/codex_review.py`)
- [x] 5.2 Codex verdict **ADAPT** recorded in `design.md` §"Cross-provider review"; all 5 findings folded (classification upheld — the findings were against this change's own design)
- [x] 5.3 Re-verify Codex findings 1 + 2 against the repo before folding, rather than accepting on report
- [x] 5.4 **Host decision resolved** — PR #1578 / `f605bb99` amended the ratified paragraph to the relay model (`design.md` §"Host decision resolved")
- [x] 5.5 Draft PR opened — #1515; auto-merge disabled while the prerequisite and current-base repairs were incomplete
- [x] 5.6 Re-run current-base gates at `7a118dca`: strict all-spec validation 29/29, archive annotations 11/11, successor requirements/scenarios 7/17, focused tests 75 passed + 1 skipped, diff checks clean, independent final review APPROVE

## 6. Implementation (this change stays ACTIVE until these land)

> Codex finding 1: the survivors are unbuilt, and `openspec/specs/` is as-built truth
> (`openspec/config.yaml`: "do not spec aspirations"). There is deliberately **no
> pre-implementation `sync-specs`** — task 6.11 becomes eligible only after the code and tests
> below exist.
>
> **Section-6 disposition premise-verified against `origin/main` 2026-07-24; cross-family
> review Codex ADAPT 2026-07-24. Per-task rollup, endpoint inventory, the 6.2 reconciliation
> contract, and the 6.3 metric definition live in `implementation-notes.md`.** 6.1–6.3 are
> *definition* gates (advanceable now); 6.4–6.11 are *implementation* tasks that need code +
> tests. An unbuilt implementation dependency does not block the definition that gates it.

- [ ] 6.1 Define the anti-collision write restriction concretely before implementation — exact external/commons endpoint, predicate, redirect destination — and confirm it does not restrict the governed founder-learning path (`founder.md`) — **ADVANCED (host-gated residual):** endpoint (both `write_page` servers' commons path), redirect (`converse`), and founder-learning exemption named in `implementation-notes.md` §6.1; the *whether-to-enforce + exact person-dossier predicate* is the residual host decision (open PR #1583, audit-only "DO NOT MERGE without host review", recommends a `host-decision`). Do NOT implement (that is 6.7) until it resolves.
- [x] 6.2 Reconcile interlocutor tier binding with the `universe-visibility` change's anonymous-reader semantics and record the agreed authority/disclosure contract — **DISCHARGED:** spec-level tier↔visibility contract recorded in `implementation-notes.md` §6.2 (T0 ≡ unauthenticated reader; disclosure = tier ∩ visibility; fail-closed on undeclared; source-separation). Implementation landed as 6.6 against the merged `universe-visibility` machinery — the contract was re-verified against `tinyassets/api/visibility.py` as built, per this section's own "re-verify before 6.6 lands" residual.
- [x] 6.3 Define baseline, metric, and permitted regression for connector tool-selection accuracy, and file it against `live-mcp-connector-surface` (residual of retired task 2.9) — **FILED:** `openspec/changes/connector-tool-selection-accuracy/` (strict-valid), four ADDED requirements on `live-mcp-connector-surface` covering the fixed labelled dataset, separate top-1 / opening-turn rates, baseline gating at a recorded 0-pp default tolerance, and rendered-session-only measurement. Instrument built and tested: `tests/data/connector_tool_selection_v1.jsonl` (21 prompts, all seven handles) + `scripts/connector_tool_selection_eval.py` + `tests/test_connector_tool_selection.py` (21 tests). Recording the first baseline is that change's task 3.1 (host-action — needs a rendered `ui-test` session); its deltas are NOT synced into `openspec/specs/`.
- [ ] 6.4 Implement the whole-mind personification contract on speaking surfaces, including proof that direct-control tools remain neutral and never fabricate universe voice — **PARTIALLY LANDED:** `converse` first-person surface proven (`test_universe_intelligence.py::test_system_prompt_is_first_person_and_grounded`); direct-control neutrality proven (`test_persona.py::test_write_graph_persona_target_is_retired`, `test_relay_ux_prompts.py`). Outbound speaking surfaces do not exist yet — the requirement's "outbound surfaces" clause has nothing to discharge until one ships.
- [ ] 6.5 After 6.2: implement authorization-before-voice generalization with tests proving unauthorized content never enters persona assembly — **STILL BLOCKED (no non-founder path), but the mechanism now exists — do not rebuild it.** 6.6 landed the pre-assembly filter (`interlocutor.permitted_grounding_files` + the fail-closed refusal in `_build_persona_system_prompt`), and it is proven for T0/T1: unauthorized content is excluded during assembly rather than accompanied by a withhold instruction. What keeps 6.5 unchecked is unchanged — the founder-only floor means no non-founder caller reaches assembly in production, so the generalization has no live path to govern. Checking it requires a visitor conversation path, which is deliberately not opened here.
- [x] 6.6 After 6.2: implement authenticated interlocutor tier binding with cross-principal and `universe-visibility` disclosure tests — **LANDED.** Prior "0/10 machinery" annotation was stale: `universe-visibility` enforcement merged (PR #1734, `tinyassets/api/visibility.py`) and runs at boot. Built on it rather than rebuilding it: `tinyassets/api/interlocutor.py` resolves T0/T1/T2 from authenticated request state only (the resolver takes no message parameter, so "never from message content" is structural), and disclosure is `tier ∩ visibility_permits` — tighten-only, with the visibility layer as the ceiling for **every** tier including the founder. Fail-closed agreement implemented for the case visibility alone misses (an ACL-granted reader on an *undeclared* universe). Assembly-time exclusion discharges "authorization precedes voice". Founder-only conversation floor preserved — no visitor path opened. Tests: `tests/test_interlocutor_tier.py` (41). Mutation-checked (5 gates, all red when forced open). Cross-family review: Codex **REJECT** 2026-07-25 with 2 criticals + 2 others, all reproduced as failing tests and fixed (see 6.9 note).
- [ ] 6.7 After 6.1: implement the scoped external/commons anti-collision boundary with predicate, redirect, governed-learning exemption, and adversarial tests — **BLOCKED (host decision):** gated on the #1583 enforce/predicate decision (6.1 residual).
- [x] 6.8 Implement forkable first-party persona custody with tests proving identity comes from learned self-model content while soul remains governance input and never supplies or replaces persona identity — **LANDED.** Identity-source core was already proven (`test_persona.py::test_resolve_persona_identity_never_comes_from_soul`, `persona.py`); the missing custody mechanism is now built: `persona.VOICE_FILENAME` (`voice.md`) is universe-side content the founder tunes, assembled into the intelligence's OWN system prompt between the identity line and the honesty floor. No persona script is baked into the platform (absence is the default). Floor proven unmoved by a fork — structured identity, privacy tier (composes with 6.6's filter), engine authority, honest fallback. Custody stays first-party: `persona.summary()` cannot carry the fork, asserted structurally so the test cannot pass vacuously. Tests: `tests/test_persona_custody.py` (14). Mutation-checked (4 gates). **Scoped honestly:** a fork is founder-authored text assembled verbatim, so this does not claim the substrate scrubs identity-shaped phrases from it — a predicate over founder voice would be the unscoped "reject profile-shaped content" mistake this change's own spec rejects. The enforceable floor is the structured identity every consumer reads.
- [ ] 6.9 Implement one learned identity across speaking surfaces with tests for surface/interlocutor modulation without identity replacement — **HALF LANDED — deliberately NOT checked.** The requirement has two halves and only one is dischargeable today.
      - **Interlocutor half — DONE** (unblocked by 6.6): the same learned identity speaks at every tier while disclosure narrows. `tests/test_interlocutor_tier.py::TestOneIdentityAcrossInterlocutors` proves the learned name is identical in the T0/T1/T2 assembled prompts, that founder-private grounding is present for T2 and absent for T0/T1 on the same universe (modulation without replacement), and that the operational soul never becomes a second identity.
      - **Cross-surface half — BLOCKED (external):** "across founder chat, visitor conversation, and outbound speaking surfaces" needs surfaces that do not exist. `converse` is the only speaking surface today; outbound surfaces are owned by the active `outbound-boundary-layer` change (same gate as 6.4), and no non-founder conversation path exists (the founder-only floor is preserved on purpose — see 6.5).
      Checking 6.9 now would advance the 6.11 sync gate on a half-satisfied requirement, writing an unbuilt cross-surface guarantee into as-built spec truth. It stays unchecked until an outbound surface ships.
- [ ] 6.10 Implement Tiny as the platform universe's governed personification with tests proving self-as-platform grants no authority bypass — **BLOCKED (unbuilt/design-gated):** no `Tiny`/platform-universe personification code exists; a substantial feature intersecting platform-universe architecture that needs its own design gate.
- [ ] 6.11 Only after 6.4–6.10 and the task 6.3 connector evidence gate: `sync-specs` into `openspec/specs/universe-personification-and-relay/spec.md`, then archive this change — **BLOCKED — MUST NOT RUN:** gated on 6.4–6.10 + 6.3; running it now writes unbuilt aspirations into `openspec/specs/`, the exact failure this change exists to prevent.
