# Design: no anonymous principal

Revised after Codex design round 1 (2026-09-02, ADAPT): exempt paths
corrected to the routes that exist, `runs.actor` and the Source-event thread
named as identity sources, the canary kept narrow, `/pulse` moved under the
proxied prefix with `image_tag`, and the PR-1 boundary widened to what must
land together.

## D1. Identity is present or the request is refused

`tinyassets/auth/middleware.py`

- `_current_identity: ContextVar[Identity | None]` with default `None`.
- `auth_middleware(token)`: no token -> `_current_identity.set(None)`,
  return `None`. Present-but-invalid token -> `None` in every mode (today dev
  mode downgrades it to anonymous).
- `current_identity()` -> `Identity`; raises `PermissionError("Authentication
  required")` when unset. `current_identity_or_none()` exists for the places
  that legitimately branch on presence: the ASGI challenge path, status's
  `request_identity` block (`bearer_present`), and the app's
  `_app_identity_required` gate (which imports the deleted sentinel today
  and moves into this PR).
- `AuthContextMiddleware.__call__`: seeds `None`, not a sentinel. After
  `auth_middleware`, if identity is `None` and the path is not in the exempt
  table (D3), answer 401 with the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge
  (`invalid_token=True` when a token was present, else the plain challenge).
  The anonymous-write pre-dispatch classifier, the 1 MiB anonymous body cap
  and `register_anonymous_write_challenge_tool` are deleted: there is no
  anonymous request body to classify.
- `require_auth` / `require_action_scope`: the `user_id == "anonymous"`
  branches go; `current_identity()` already refused.

`tinyassets/auth/provider.py`

- `ANONYMOUS` deleted. `HOST` stays (a named identity).
- `AuthProvider.challenge_unauthenticated()` deleted: challenging is the
  transport rule, not a provider option. `resolve_always_writes` and
  `writes_require_identity` stay only as scope-enforcement switches.
- `DevAuthProvider.resolve_token(token)`: returns a named local identity
  from `UNIVERSE_SERVER_DEV_USER` for any token; `create_provider()` in dev
  mode raises at startup when that variable is unset. A missing token in dev
  mode is still `None` -> 401: local clients send any bearer.
- The `oauth_sessions.user_id ... DEFAULT 'anonymous'` column default becomes
  `NOT NULL` with no default (migration fails loudly naming any row that
  carries it).

`tinyassets/api/permissions.py`

- `current_request_actor_id()` returns the subject or raises; it never
  returns `"anonymous"`. `is_authenticated_request()` becomes
  `current_identity_or_none() is not None`. `current_actor_id()` is the same
  as `current_request_actor_id()`; one of them is deleted.
- `OperatorRequestAdmissionVerdict.actor_id / tenant_id` are never defaulted.

`tinyassets/api/engine_helpers.py`, `tinyassets/identity.py`, and every
`os.environ.get("UNIVERSE_SERVER_USER", "anonymous")`

- Deleted. The actor is the authenticated subject, or the write refuses. The
  git author slug in `identity.py` is derived from the bound identity only;
  with none bound it raises rather than falling back to an anonymous slug.

`tinyassets/engine_mcp_server.py` (`_bind_founder_identity`) and
`tinyassets/onboarding/__init__.py` (`_app_identity_required`)

- An empty `actor_id` is `_binding_error`, never a bound stand-in. The app
  gate compares against `None`, not the sentinel. Both land in PR 1 because
  both import the deleted symbol.

## D2. Runs and events carry their principal explicitly

`runs.actor` is an identity source, not an author field: it has a SQL
`DEFAULT 'anonymous'`, `create_run(actor="anonymous")` defaults, and
`canonical_dispatch` reads it back as authority context. In PR 1:

- `create_run` and every caller require `actor`; the column loses its default
  (migration fails loudly on a row that carries `'anonymous'` and lists it;
  such rows are historical and are never re-dispatched).
- Scheduled runs and the automations consumer already carry a stored owner
  principal and pass it to `run_fn`; the **Source-event thread does not**
  (`webhook_inbound._emit_source_event` builds `SchedulerEvent(event_type,
  event_id, payload)` with no identity, `scheduler._dispatch_event` calls
  `run_fn` without `principal_id`, and `api/runs` falls back to a request
  identity that does not exist on that thread). The hook itself records no
  owner today: `webhook_hooks` stores universe, branch and source ids only,
  and `_action_create_source` knows the caller transiently. So (Codex round
  2): `webhook_hooks` gains `owner_principal_id`, written by
  `_action_create_source` from the authenticated caller and returned by
  `resolve`; `SchedulerEvent` gains `owner_principal_id`, stamped in
  `_emit_source_event` from the resolved hook; it flows `_dispatch_event` ->
  `_inbound_event_run_fn` -> `enqueue_universe_branch_run` ->
  `_bind_run_provider_call`, whose explicit-principal path already needs no
  lookup. BOTH mint paths record the owner (Codex round 3): `_action_mint_webhook`
  (a plain branch hook, delivered directly by `handle_hook` ->
  `enqueue_universe_branch_run`) and `_action_create_source` (a Source, delivered
  through the bus); the direct path passes `principal_id` from the resolved hook
  exactly as the bus path does. A legacy hook with no recorded owner refuses to
  deliver, logging the hook prefix (fail closed; the owner re-creates it). This is the fix the
  2026-09-02 event-subscription concern asked for, and it lands with D1
  because the raising `current_identity()` otherwise breaks that path.
  Binding the owner in the HTTP `ContextVar` alone does not cross the
  queue/thread boundary.

Authors: `BranchDefinition.author`, `NodeDefinition.author`, `extensions`
authors, `branch_versions` publisher, `catalog/serializer` author, `market`
claimer / staker / caller, `runtime_ops.owner_actor`, `selector_dispatch.actor`,
`interlocutor.actor_id`: no `"anonymous"` default (PR 2). A missing author at
write time raises; readers that meet a stored `"anonymous"` author treat it
as unowned, never as a principal that can match a caller; a one-shot script
lists such rows. The interlocutor tier `T0` is deleted.

## D3. Exempt paths keep their own named authentication

The routes that exist today, not a sketch:

| path | who authenticates | principal bound |
|---|---|---|
| `/.well-known/*` and `/mcp/.well-known/*` (both are mounted by `starlette_discovery_routes`; production challenges advertise the `/mcp/` variant; the `/oauth/*` descriptor in `create_wellknown_routes` is unmounted and gets no exemption) | OAuth discovery | none: no handler reads state |
| `/mcp/app` static shell; `/mcp/app/token` (PKCE exchange, refresh, logout) | the app's PKCE flow / refresh cookie | the signed-in user, or the flow itself; every other `/mcp/app/*` route requires the bearer through `_app_identity_required` |
| `/mcp/connect/*` (the existing traversal-safe predicate, not a prefix) | connect-deposit session | the depositing user |
| `/mcp/hooks/<id>` (the existing exactly-one-segment predicate, not a prefix) | per-hook secret | the hook's OWNER, stamped on the emitted event (D2) |
| `/mcp/app/billing/webhook` | Stripe signature (already exempt with its own auth) | none: the handler binds the customer from the event |
| `/mcp/pulse` | none | none: release facts only (D5) |

Everything else, including `POST /mcp` `initialize`, is 401 without a valid
bearer. The table is one predicate with a test per row, and no row is a
wildcard prefix (Codex round 2: literal prefixes would open deeper or
crafted paths that the existing predicates refuse).

## D4. Probes are the `canary` service principal, kept as narrow as today

Codex: a coarse `read`/`list` canary would read any public universe, and the
handle layer does not enforce capabilities uniformly. So the canary does NOT
gain a capability set. It keeps its existing argument fence and gains a
**central service-principal handle allowlist** in the middleware:

- The bearer `TINYASSETS_WIKI_CANARY_TOKEN` resolves to identity `canary`.
- A request under it is admitted only for: `initialize`,
  `notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`, `tools/call get_status` with no
  arguments, `tools/call read_graph target=status`, and the wiki canary's
  exact `write_page` / `read_page` shapes it already enforces. Anything else
  is refused before dispatch with a scope error.
- Where: in `AuthContextMiddleware.__call__`, after the bearer resolves to
  `canary` and before `await self.app`, validating every item of a single or
  batch JSON-RPC body before replaying it (Codex round 2). That is outside
  FastMCP dispatch, so neither the legacy fat tools nor
  `_DeprecatedToolVisibility` (which filters `tools/list` only) can bypass it.
- Every probe script in `scripts/` (the nine in the inventory) sends it;
  without the variable set they exit 2 naming it.
- `scripts/mcp_public_canary.py`: an unauthenticated `initialize` MUST answer
  the 401 challenge (assertion 1); `--assert-handles` proceeds with the bearer.
- The 14 workflows pass the secret (`p0-outage-triage.yml` and
  `restart-daemon.yml` included).

## D5. `GET /mcp/pulse` and the website

- Under the `/mcp` prefix because the Cloudflare Worker proxies only `/mcp*`.
- Body: `git_sha`, `image_tag`, `deployed_at`, `uptime_seconds`. `image_tag`
  is included because `scripts/deployed_sha.py` corroborates `git_sha` with
  it and exits "cannot tell" without it; the gate is not weakened.
- Served before the auth middleware; reads `release-state.json` only.
- `scripts/deployed_sha.py` reads it instead of `tools/call get_status`.
- `WebSite/site/src/lib/mcp/live.ts`, `playground.ts`,
  `site-react/lib/live.ts` read it. The playground's anonymous wire trace is
  replaced by the 401 challenge as step one of a real connection.

## D6. Status reports presence, never a stand-in

`api/status.py`: `request_identity.principal_fingerprint` from the
authenticated subject only; `bearer_present` stays; no anonymous session
branch.

## D7. What lands where

**PR 1 (this change):** D1, D2's run/event parts, D3, D4, D5, D6, and the
tests they need. Codex round 1 established that the sink deletion cannot
be a separate green PR for: `_app_identity_required`,
`_bind_founder_identity`, `runs.actor` defaults and callers, and the
Source-event propagation; those are in PR 1.
**PR 2:** the remaining ~80 string gates and ~60 author defaults, the
`grep anonymous tinyassets/` zero-line test.
**PR 3:** spec sync, environment-variable catalog, Hard Rules 11 and 14
gain the bearer, archive.

## D9. The cutover seam (Codex code review round 1, finding E)

The probes cannot simply require the bearer. The image production runs until
this deploys honours that token only for the exact wiki write and answers an
anonymous `initialize` with 200, so a probe that always authenticates is red
against a healthy production for the whole window between merge and deploy --
and permanently after a rollback, while the container's own healthcheck
reports green. That is the worst shape available: a gate that fails on the
build it is protecting.

So a probe ASKS which contract the daemon keeps. `GET /mcp/pulse` is served
only by this build, so a 200 identifies it and a 404 identifies the previous
one (`scripts/_canary_common.server_enforces_bearer`). Each probe negotiates
once in `main()`, after the URL is known, and honours that answer for every
step of the run:

- new daemon: send the bearer, assert the 401 challenge on an anonymous
  `initialize`, assert 403 on a canary `converse`;
- previous daemon: probe anonymously and say so in the verbose line, which
  names only the checks that actually ran.

`scripts/deployed_sha.py` does the same, falling back to the anonymous
`get_status` read when `/mcp/pulse` 404s, so Hard Rule 14 is runnable
throughout. Proven live 2026-09-02 from the branch: both gates green against
the pre-cutover production.

The seam is dated and deletes itself. PR 3 removes it once production has been
on this image long enough that a rollback past it is not a scenario.

## D8. Testing

- `signed_in(user_id)` fixture replaces every `_logout()` /
  `auth_middleware(None)` that expected an anonymous read to succeed; those
  tests assert the 401 / `PermissionError`.
- A test per D3 row; a test that a Source event carries and runs under its
  hook owner; a test that the canary bearer is refused on every handle
  outside its allowlist.
- The canary runs against the container oracle with and without the token
  before the deploy PR merges.

## Decisions taken here, flagged for the founder

Codex round 1 listed these as product choices the directive does not make.
Each is decided below with the reason; any can be reversed by the founder.

1. **Canary authority: narrow allowlist, not a capability.** Least privilege;
   the probes never needed more.
2. **Dev principal: `UNIVERSE_SERVER_DEV_USER`, fail-loud, no fixed name.** A
   fixed `local-operator` is a default identity by another name.
3. **Website: pulse only; the playground shows the 401 challenge first.**
   An anonymous MCP round-trip is exactly what the rule forbids.
4. **Legacy `"anonymous"` authors are unowned and listed, not rewritten.**
   Rewriting attribution invents provenance; listing lets the founder decide
   per row.
5. **`/mcp/pulse` fields: `git_sha`, `image_tag`, `deployed_at`,
   `uptime_seconds`.** Nothing that names a universe or a user.
6. **Legacy rows are quarantined, not fatal (Codex round 3).** OAuth sessions
   whose `user_id` is `anonymous` are deleted by the migration (they were
   never a person); run rows whose actor is `anonymous` are logged at ERROR
   once at startup, listed, and never re-dispatched; hooks with no recorded
   owner refuse delivery with a logged error and the caller's uniform 404
   until the owner re-creates them. No deployment fails on legacy data.
