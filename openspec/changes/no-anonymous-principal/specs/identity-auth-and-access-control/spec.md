# identity-auth-and-access-control (delta)

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Anonymous read, authenticated write (resolve-always posture)

Removed. There is no anonymous principal (founder, 2026-08-22 and 2026-09-02).
A request without a valid bearer is refused with a 401 challenge on every
non-exempt path, reads included. Replaced by *Every request carries a named
principal or is challenged* below.

### Requirement: Anonymous writes on pure-write handles draw a pre-dispatch 401 challenge

Removed. The pre-dispatch classifier, the anonymous body cap and the pure-write
tool registry existed to challenge anonymous writes while leaving anonymous
reads open. With no anonymous request there is nothing to classify: the
transport challenges every unauthenticated request before dispatch.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Every request carries a named principal or is challenged

The auth middleware SHALL resolve a bearer token to an `Identity` or to
nothing; it SHALL NOT construct a stand-in identity for a missing or invalid
token in any auth mode. `current_identity()` SHALL raise `PermissionError`
when no identity is bound. On every path outside the exempt table the ASGI
middleware SHALL answer HTTP 401 with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` challenge
carrying the resource-metadata URL when no valid bearer is present, including
for JSON-RPC `initialize`, `tools/list` and every `tools/call`. No
environment variable SHALL supply an actor or a git author. The dev provider
SHALL resolve a named local identity from `UNIVERSE_SERVER_DEV_USER` and the
server SHALL refuse to start in dev mode without it.

#### Scenario: missing bearer on the MCP endpoint
- **WHEN** a client POSTs `initialize` to `/mcp` with no `Authorization` header
- **THEN** the response is HTTP 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="..."`
- **AND** no handler runs and no identity is bound

#### Scenario: invalid bearer in dev mode
- **WHEN** the provider is the dev provider and a request carries a bearer it cannot resolve
- **THEN** the response is HTTP 401 with `error="invalid_token"`, not a downgrade to any identity

#### Scenario: code that reads identity outside a request
- **WHEN** `current_identity()` is called with nothing bound
- **THEN** it raises `PermissionError("Authentication required")`

### Requirement: Exempt paths bind their own named principal

Exactly these paths SHALL be served without the MCP bearer, each binding a
named principal or reading no state: the OAuth discovery routes
(`/.well-known/*` and `/mcp/.well-known/*`); the app shell `/mcp/app` and
its PKCE exchange, refresh and logout route `/mcp/app/token` (the signed-in
user, or the flow itself); the connect-deposit routes `/mcp/connect/*` (the
depositing user's session, matched by the existing traversal-safe
predicate); inbound hook routes `/mcp/hooks/<id>` (exactly one path segment,
the existing predicate; the hook's owner is stamped on the emitted event);
`/mcp/app/billing/webhook` (Stripe-signed; the handler binds the customer
from the event); and `GET /mcp/pulse` (release facts only). No other path
SHALL be exempt, and no exemption SHALL be a wildcard prefix.

#### Scenario: inbound hook runs as its owner
- **WHEN** a valid hook secret arrives on `/mcp/hooks/<id>`
- **THEN** the emitted event carries the hook owner's principal and the run binds to it without a further lookup

#### Scenario: a hook with no recorded owner
- **WHEN** a valid secret arrives for a hook stored before owners were recorded
- **THEN** the hook refuses to emit, naming the hook, and nothing runs

#### Scenario: pulse carries no universe state
- **WHEN** `GET /mcp/pulse` is called with no bearer
- **THEN** the body carries only `git_sha`, `image_tag`, `deployed_at` and `uptime_seconds`

### Requirement: Runs and events carry an explicit actor

`create_run` SHALL require `actor`; the `runs.actor` column SHALL have no
default; a dispatch SHALL never treat a missing actor as a principal.
Scheduled runs, automation runs and Source-event runs SHALL each carry the
owner principal stored with the schedule, automation or hook.

#### Scenario: legacy anonymous run rows
- **WHEN** the migration finds a run row whose actor is `anonymous`
- **THEN** it fails loud listing the rows, and no such row is ever re-dispatched

### Requirement: Operational probes are the canary service principal

The bearer configured as `TINYASSETS_WIKI_CANARY_TOKEN` SHALL resolve to the
identity `canary`. The canary SHALL hold no capability set; instead the auth
middleware SHALL admit a request under it only when every item of its
JSON-RPC body (single or batch) is one of: `initialize`,
`notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`, `tools/call get_status` with no
arguments, `tools/call read_graph` with `target=status`, or the wiki canary's
exact `write_page` / `read_page` shapes. Any other item SHALL be refused
before dispatch. Every probe script in `scripts/` that calls the MCP endpoint
SHALL send the bearer; without the variable set the script SHALL exit 2
naming it. `scripts/mcp_public_canary.py` SHALL assert that an
unauthenticated `initialize` answers the 401 challenge, then use the bearer
for `--assert-handles`. `scripts/deployed_sha.py` SHALL read `/mcp/pulse` and
keep its `image_tag` corroboration.

#### Scenario: canary without its token
- **WHEN** `mcp_public_canary.py --assert-handles` runs with the variable unset
- **THEN** it exits 2 and names `TINYASSETS_WIKI_CANARY_TOKEN`

#### Scenario: canary attempts anything else
- **WHEN** the canary bearer calls `write_graph`, `run_graph`, `converse`, or `read_graph` with any target but `status`
- **THEN** the request is refused before dispatch and nothing is read or written

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Auth provider is selected by configuration, defaulting to no-auth

The auth provider SHALL be selected by `UNIVERSE_SERVER_AUTH`: unset or false
selects the dev provider, `true`/`oauth` the full OAuth provider,
`optional`/`resolve` the optional OAuth provider, `workos` the WorkOS
provider. In every mode a request without a valid bearer SHALL be challenged;
the modes differ only in how a bearer is validated and whether named action
scopes are enforced on writes. The dev provider SHALL require
`UNIVERSE_SERVER_DEV_USER` and resolve every bearer to that named identity.

#### Scenario: dev mode without a named user
- **WHEN** the server starts with `UNIVERSE_SERVER_AUTH` unset and `UNIVERSE_SERVER_DEV_USER` unset
- **THEN** startup fails naming `UNIVERSE_SERVER_DEV_USER`

### Requirement: Bearer JWT validation is fail-closed, RS256-pinned, and audience-bound

The WorkOS provider SHALL validate bearer JWTs with a pinned RS256 key set,
SHALL require `exp` and `sub`, SHALL reject any token whose subject is
missing, and SHALL bind the audience. A token that fails validation SHALL
resolve to nothing, and the transport SHALL answer 401 `invalid_token`; no
identity is bound for it.

#### Scenario: expired token
- **WHEN** a request carries an expired bearer
- **THEN** token resolution returns nothing and the response is HTTP 401 with `error="invalid_token"`

### Requirement: Founder home auto-births exactly once on first authenticated contact

On the first `converse` from an authenticated founder with create scope and no
home universe, the server SHALL resolve-or-create and bind one blank seed home
exactly once, then continue the originating conversation. `get_status` and
`read_graph target=status` SHALL never provision. There is no unauthenticated
session that could reach either.

#### Scenario: first contact
- **WHEN** an authenticated founder with no home calls `converse`
- **THEN** exactly one home is created and bound, and the turn continues

### Requirement: The permission actor is the authenticated subject with no environment fallback

The permission actor SHALL be exactly the authenticated request subject. With
no identity bound, actor resolution SHALL raise `PermissionError`; it SHALL
NOT resolve to any stand-in, and no universe-server environment variable
SHALL confer identity, authorship or write authority.

#### Scenario: unauthenticated request
- **WHEN** a permission check runs with no identity bound
- **THEN** it raises `PermissionError` and no action is authorized

### Requirement: Access is controlled on two orthogonal axes, visibility and ownership

Universe access SHALL be decided on visibility (public, private, rule-scoped)
and on the ownership ACL, for authenticated callers. A public universe SHALL
be readable by any authenticated caller; a private universe by its ACL rows
only; all writes by an actor holding write or admin on that universe. There
is no unauthenticated reader.

#### Scenario: signed-in reader of a public universe
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller with no ACL row reads a public universe
- **THEN** the read succeeds

#### Scenario: signed-in reader of a private universe
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller with no ACL row reads a private universe
- **THEN** the response is the uniform not-found envelope

### Requirement: Status identity evidence varies across three response shapes

`get_status` SHALL report `request_identity.bearer_present` and a
`principal_fingerprint` derived from the authenticated subject only. There is
no anonymous fingerprint prefix and no environment-actor fallback shape; the
three shapes are: founder of the universe, authenticated non-founder, and
the `canary` service principal.

#### Scenario: canary reads status
- **WHEN** the canary bearer calls `get_status`
- **THEN** `request_identity.principal_fingerprint` is the canary's and `release_state` is present

### Requirement: Scoped wiki canary bearer grants no general identity

The canary bearer SHALL resolve to the `canary` service identity whose only
admitted requests are the allowlist above; it SHALL NOT hold write, costly or
admin on any universe. Its confinement is the allowlist enforced before
dispatch, not anonymity and not a capability set.

#### Scenario: canary attempts a write
- **WHEN** the canary bearer calls `write_graph`
- **THEN** the request is refused before dispatch and nothing is written
