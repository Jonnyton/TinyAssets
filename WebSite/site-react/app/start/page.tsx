                  Email sign-in. The first time you arrive, a blank universe is created for you and
                  bound to your account. There is nothing to configure yet.

                <p>
                  Open the Connect view. ChatGPT or Codex is one tap. For Claude, paste a setup token
                  from your own Claude account into the deposit form: it goes straight into your
                  universe&apos;s vault over TLS and never passes through the chat.
                </p>
                <p className="note">
                  The platform never supplies a model. Your subscription is the only thing that runs
                  your universe. Other routes, such as your own API keys, sit behind one &ldquo;Other&rdquo;
                  control in the same view.

                  watched. The universe asks for exactly what it is missing, with links, and builds
                  the rest while you talk.
